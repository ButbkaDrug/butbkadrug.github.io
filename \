## Life of worship
For a last few weeks we've been talking about living the **LIFE OF WORHSIP**. And today we gonna continue with this topic. If new here, we are studing the book of Romans. Currently we're at the chapter 12. At the beginning of this chapter we are presented with the concept of a **“living sacrifice”** — a spiritual service of worship that is acceptable to God.

### Question
Did you ever asked yourself a question. What does God want's me to do? What is the will of God for my life?

If you never thought about it. Well... you probobly should. It is an important question. Once you know the answer life start to make so much more sense. And honestly the answer is not complicated.

We are about to uncover the secret and sacrid truth, so I'll need your full attaention. Let this truth soak in, and it will revolutionize your life.

Are you ready?

**God desires that your life be a song of love to Him.**

What?

**God desires that your life be a song of love to Him.**

But, I don't understand. I am no singer. And what does it even mean?

### Example
Yeah, I know how that feels. Many years ago, when I was very yang and naive. I was looking for a secret of singing. I wanted to sing good. Actually, I wanted to be really good. And those days predate youtube and white spread of information. So, I had to digg in into forums and dodgy websites searching for the answer "How to become a good singer". And you would not belive how much rubbish is out there. Hours of my life and liters of tea were waisted on that endless search. But then, one day, luck was on my side.

I found a training programm! It looks very promising. Looks legit! I hit download and start waiting.

Serveral following ours felt endless. But, now I have it. The secret tool that will unlish my voice! 

I had to  wait until I was home alone. And finally, I can go into my room. It is dark hare, because computer monitor is the only source of light. House is so quite, the only noises are from  computer cooler spinning. I can hear my heart pounding in my chest. My palms are sweaty, because I'm so nervouse. What if it's yet another fake?

Few moments of hasitation and then. I sit down and pressed the play button. Music starts to play, and after a short into the vocal coach finally starts speaking. I’m all ears for what he says. And...

> "Keep your throat relaxed and open, so air flows freely and your voice can resonate."

WHAT?

> "Raise your soft palate slightly"

WHAAAT?!

> "Gently bring your vocal folds together without squeezing, letting them vibrate freely."

WHAAAAAAAT?!! Is that it?? That is what I was looking for???

Generally speaking yes. In a nutshell it is the recepe for a great sounding voice.

Luckly, the program included hours and hours of vocal excersises for practice, with the examples to follow.

### Bridge
You know, both, our christian life and singing. Is not about knowing a *"secret formula of a success"*. Some sort of a hidden knowladge that avalible to only a few. No, it's about excersising the right thing day after day. Because, you know, one thing that sets professionals apart from ammatures, is that professionals keep practicing day in and day out. They are working out, they are consistently building their voice.

Living a **life of worship** is about practicing, excersising or as it put in Philippians 2 "*working out* out selvation".

Before we will dive into our scripture for today, I’d like to preface this by saying everything that we gonna talk about assumes that you are born again, filled with spirit, follower of christ. Because, otherwise, without the help of the Holy Spirit, it will be extremely hard if not imposibble to live the life of worship. But above all it will be prettey much pointless in regards of eternal life. Because again, selvation and forgiveness is not by what you do, but by faith and faith alone.

With that being said let's start reading:

### Romans 12:9-21
>⁹Love *must be* free of hypocrisy. Detest what is evil; cling to what is good.¹⁰*Be* devoted to one another in brotherly love; give preference to one another in honor,¹¹not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord;¹²rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation, devoted to prayer,¹³contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality.

>¹⁴Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.¹⁵Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.¹⁶Be of the same mind toward one another; do not be haughty in mind, but associate with the lowly. Do not be wise in your own estimation.¹⁷Never repay evil for evil to anyone. Respect what is right in the sight of all people.¹⁸If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all people.¹⁹Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath *of God,* for it is written: “VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY,” says the Lord.²⁰“BUT IF YOUR ENEMY IS HUNGRY, FEED HIM; IF HE IS THIRSTY, GIVE HIM A DRINK; FOR IN SO DOING YOU WILL HEAP BURNING COALS ON HIS HEAD.”²¹Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

### Love first
We all know all this. Some might say that it is christianity one o one. And that's right. It is one of the fist things you learn as a christian. Basic christianity. And we don't need basics. We are quite advanced in our walk with the Lord and therefore we need an advanced stuff. Right? 

Let's go back for about 15 years and 2000 kilometers. Back into my dark room. Where yanger version of me having my first vocal training session. And let's learn something new together. I will teach you probobly one of the most powerful excersises for singers and speakers, anyone who uses their voice as an instrument. 

Place your index fingers about an inch away from the corner of your mouth and gently push in and up. Relax your lips and do this **BBBBB**. Like a motorcycle engine. Be careful not to spit on the person in front of you though. You gotta relax your face. Otherwise it's not gonna work. Comon, try it **BBBBBB**. Easy. But so powerful. 15 years later. I still do it. And not only me. Think of your favorite singer. It is almost garanteed that he does this excersise too. Every day of his life, until the end of his singing careere.

### Excersising
Do you see where we are going with this?

When did you practised drills for your inner man last time? Our scripture for today contains a few of them. Excersises for your spiritual growth.

### First drill
1. Verse 9: Showing a real love. Do you practice love on the regular basis at home, in church? How is that?

### 1 Corinthians 13:4-7
>⁴Love is patient, love is kind, it is not jealous; love does not brag, it is not arrogant.⁵It does not act disgracefully, it does not seek its own *benefit;* it is not provoked, does not keep an account of a wrong *suffered,*⁶it does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;⁷it keeps every confidence, it believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

2. Second part of verse 9 - Hate what is wrong. Hold tightly to what is good. This one of the characteristics of a true love. But also, it is a choice. Choice that we need to make daily. We should guard our mind, and not to give the room for the enemy. Because, frankly if we let evel snick into our heart, then it is only a matter of time for our actions to catch up.

First drill - is to excersise real love. 

### Second drill
3. Verse 10-13: Being devoted to the church.

Verses 10-13 call us to be a family.

> Every church is a family… a slightly dysfunctional one, but family nonetheless.

Me and you, we are called to show mutual respect. We are almost encoraged to compete who can show more respect for another. In a genuane way of course. And even more so, we are called to respect even if we are not respected back. This one is a bit more advanced.

We are called to work hard for the Lord. For the sake of his kingdom. And be cool about it. Even when things do not go well. Especially I want to emphesize prayer. We are called to be devoted to prayer. And it is so for a reason.

They say that:

>"Prayer is the powerhouse of the church"

Let's ask ourselves. How much power we produce? Can we produce enough power to light up entire city, or single LED unit is all we capable of? I think we can do better that this.

6. verse 13. Contributing - emphasises our care for one another. Active and practical participation in one anothers lives and needs. We are open for people to come to us for help. And the second part of this verse talks about hospitality. And the word "practicing" is actually qute strong word in original language. Later in the verse 14 same word translated as persecute. So the idea is that we are activly seaking, we persue people we don't know with hospitality. Both of this is love in action, not just kind words.

Ask yourself, when did you last time practised hospitality? When is the last time you contributed to someone's needs? Do you even know about the needs of your brothers and sisters?

I mean we called to live like a family. Respect one another, and take care of one another. We are called to share our vicories and our defeats. Verse 15. Which implies that one should be willing to share about his highs and lows. And the other should be willing to empatize. Not advice, but listen. Cry with the one. Or laugh with the one. Even if you are on the low yourself. And that's no easy job. That's one skill to master.

7. Verse 14, 17, 19 - all tell us about our reaction to injustice twords us. We all know this. But it is so hard. We all crave for justice. At least when it comes to our justice. But in the moments like that we are called to move in the opposite spirit. We are called to bless, no step back and not to take the revange. We are called to be at peace with all people, if only possible.

### DO NOT BE OVERCOME BY EVIL
And for me the verse 21 is a great summury of all of this.

### Romans 12:21
>²¹Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

In real life, two negatives don’t make a positive. It's only true for matematical problems. When it comes to real life. If you not going to abhor what is evel, if you not gonna cling to what is goood. You will be overcomed by evel. Every one of this thigs is a layer of protection over our hearts against evel of this world.

And it starts from transformation of our minds, our worldview, our attituede.
