The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. ²Beloved, we are God\u0026rsquo;s children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. ³And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.\n⁴Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. ⁵You know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. ⁶No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. ⁷Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous. ⁸ Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. ⁹ No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God\u0026rsquo;s seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God. ¹⁰By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother.\nShrink In Shame 1 John 2:28 ²⁸And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he appears we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at his coming.\nToday we start off with a warning from John. He reminds us about the end. And same as Jesus said: \u0026ldquo;Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven\u0026rdquo;(Matt. 7:21). John tells us that not all who know about Jesus will have confidence at his coming. Some people not gonna be happy at all. And it is not about those who do not know Christ. No, in this scripture we talking only about those who claim to be a follower. Last Sunday we started to talk about some of them. Antichrists - people who do not believe that Jesus is Christ the messiah.\nReality is that all kinds of false pseudo Christ teachings exist out there. Some people can\u0026rsquo;t comprehend how simple the Gospel is. They are looking for something move advanced. And event though Bible has the depth, that we yet to uncover, in the pursue of the sacred knowledge, people get off track. Some others believe that THEY have been trusted with a NEW revelation. That angels or God himself uncovered that for them. Bible gets discarded as legacy and outdated source. And people start to move \u0026ldquo;by spirit\u0026rdquo;. Every cult, sect, an false teaching started this way.\nGW probably are in the park right now. Recently we\u0026rsquo;ve had some Mormon visitors in our church. I mean it\u0026rsquo;s real. Even when people do not belong to a particular cult. They can live in delusion about their false believes. Like a person who is slowly loosing the eyesight. They think that their vision is good. My son argued with me when I took him to check his vision. He were claiming that his vision is perfect, he was getting angry that I do not agree. But then, when he actually got the glasses. He was amazed. He got back something he didn\u0026rsquo;t know he lost. But in the moment he was convinced that we(his parents) are so wrong, and he knows what he is talking about. He knows the truth\nSame can happen to us. Our spiritual vision can get worse and we will fall into some false believes.Without realizing it. We would think that WE are right. When in reality we already almost blind.That\u0026rsquo;s why it is important to stay connected. To belong to a church. To have people who can speak into your life, people that you will actually listen too.\nWrong ideas, theologies, false teachings had always been around. Trying to snick into your heart and soul. It is like an infection, like a parasite that can kill you. But John gives us an ultimate cure. Natural remedy that will take care of all our spiritual inflammations. Abide in Him. As simple as that.\nAbide to have confidence and not shirk from him in shame when he comes.\nJesus is coming back Jesus is coming back. We all know it and hopefully we anticipate his second coming. Bible is clear that this day will come and we not gonna know when it will happen. There is no way to know when you will meet the Lord. Jesus says:\nMatthew 25:13,14 ¹³ Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why it is important to be always ready. So that you can have confidence. Like a good kid, who does what he should and obey his parent. He is not concerned when parents are coming home. He is confident, hew knows that he not gonna get in trouble.\nTo be honest, I was not always like that as the kid. Me and my friends did all kinds of stupid things while parents wasn\u0026rsquo;t home. Things I knew I\u0026rsquo;m not allowed to do. And I can tell you, I WAS concerned and was very worried about my parents coming home early.\nWe are children of God, who happened to be \u0026ldquo;home alone\u0026rdquo; so to speak. And we are waiting for our Master to coming back. And what we gonna feel at his coming is up to us. At the end of his life apostle Paul says:\n2 Timothy 4:7,8 ⁷ I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. ⁸Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing.\nPaul had confidence that he will be with God. And more then just that, he was sure that God will be pleased with him. Not only he kept the faith, but he also fought a good fight.\nUnfortunately not all of us will be like Paul. It is very possible for a person to start his journey well, and drift away later. We can see examples of it from the beginning. It happen to first people in the garden of Eden. They knew God. Once they had fellowship and had no fear. But then, when they broke his word their attitude have changed:\nGenesis 3:8-13 \u0026hellip;⁸And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God\u0026hellip;\nThey had no confidence. They were afraid. They were not exited about the Lord\u0026rsquo;s coming. Like a naughty kids, they were ashamed and frightened. The same will be on the day when Jesus will come back. Some people, who once followed Him, will be ashamed, they will be looking for shelter to hide. They will shirk from him in shame.\nBut it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be this way. It is up to us, because God already did everything possible on His side of things.\nChildren Of God 1 John 3:1-3 ¹See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him.²Beloved, we are God\u0026rsquo;s children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is.³And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.\nOur Heavenly Father went above and beyond in his mission to save us from our sins. Not only our penalty got nullified, but also we were privileged to become children of God. He merged us into His family. And it is not just a promise of something that will happen in the future. No, it was already done.\nWhen we get born again, born of the spirit. We get born as God\u0026rsquo;s children. John says that we are God\u0026rsquo;s children now. We still in our old body. We still wrestle with our old self. But, we already are God\u0026rsquo;s children.\n\u0026hellip;The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him\nI want us to have a look at the verb TO KNOW. It often used in this letter. Let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at original word and it\u0026rsquo;s meaning in the biblical context, because I think we don\u0026rsquo;t perceive it the same way anymore.\nIn original textl γινώσκω (ginṓskō) - \u0026ldquo;to know\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;to recognize,\u0026rdquo; but it often goes beyond mere intellectual knowledge. It typically implies a deeper, more intimate understanding, experience, or relationship. In biblical usage, ginṓskō often points to a type of knowing that involves relationship, intimacy, and understanding on a deeper, experiential level, not just cognitive recognition.\nWorldly system doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand us, doesn\u0026rsquo;t love us. Because, it does not understand and does not love God.\nI think every one of us helped stranger at least once. We help \u0026ldquo;homeless\u0026rdquo; people on streets. Give them money, or buy food for them. I didn\u0026rsquo;t many times. I remember many times, when I would go be coming back home late at night. It is dark: And I would see a man laying i\nJohn 3:5-7 ”⁵Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.⁶ That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.⁷ Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’\nPitt-Watson’s sermon prep: Read \u0026amp; reread Read different translations Commentaries \u0026amp; Heb/Greek Look up theologically important words Write a free paraphrase of the passage Write a theme sentence. From the paraphrase, distill a single sentence of the essence of the sermon to preach. Simple, no big words. Much work. Write a purpose statement answering, “Why am I talking about this passage \u0026amp; what do I expect this sermon to achieve?” Consonant with the original purpose of the author (honest exegesis). Strategies of development: We think the theme Doctrine, ethics, psychological We feel the theme Emotive aspects We activate the theme Find the imperative We invert the theme What does the theme sentence look like when the concepts are inverted? We augment and diminish the theme On a small, personal scale and on a huge scale, how is this theme true? Personal, society, global, cosmic scales. We picture and story the theme Illustrations and narratives around the theme What does the theme look like as a picture? Scripting tip: Don’t write out the sermon until you’ve outlined the sermon and done the work of development. You need all the parts assembled first. So that it has organic unity. Write the introduction last Start and end each “paragraph” with a key sentence that encapsulates the content. For more extemporaneous speech. Prep Paraphrase 2:28-29 - Considering all the topics like:\ndon\u0026rsquo;t love the world abide in God Word live by the book love brothers do not reject Jesus as the Son of God etc. John calls us to abide in Him which will ensure that we will have confidence on the day. And we not gonna be ashamed(genesis adam and eve hid and were ashamed) when He comes. We talk about people who knew Christ but their actions didn\u0026rsquo;t follow God\u0026rsquo;s guidelines. We know and accept without arguing that God is righteous, and everyone who practices righteous is off God\u0026rsquo;s people. Or if we would reverse this statement we would say that \u0026ldquo;only those who practices righteous are from God.\u0026rdquo;\nJohn calls us to think again. To see how big of a blessing God gave us. He calls us His children. John emphasises that we are not gonna BECOME children of God. But, rather we already are. This is why world does not know us, does not understand us. Because, the world do not know and do not understand God. Next is that even though we already are children of God. But it\u0026rsquo;s not yet the end. We will be transformed when Jesus will return. We do not know how it would look like and so on. We only know that we would be like Jesus. We will see Him as He is. And it will cause us to change. So anyone who hopes to be part of it, is in the process of purification because Jesus is pure.\nOn the other hand we have people who make practices of sinning. Which same as breaking God\u0026rsquo;s law. But we know that there is no sin in Jesus. And he came to take away the sin. Which clearly show that if a person keep sinning as a habit, as a regular practice, he never really understood or knew Christ Jesus. Let\u0026rsquo;s not let clever talks to make us confused. Gospel is very simple at it\u0026rsquo;s core. And it is as simple as those who practices righteousness is of God, because he is righteous. And we as children inherit this quality form our Father. But, who ever makes practice of sinning have qualities of the devil. Because, he was the one who has been sinning from the beginning.\nAnd one of the main reasons for Jesus to come was to destroy the works of the devil.\nBottom line is that no one who truly got to know God keeps practicing sinning. Because when you been born again, you inherit characteristics of your Father. God\u0026rsquo;s seed(?sperm) is in you, meaning that you are like Him. And thus cannot make habit of sinning, because he has not sin in him.\nAnd here is a true way to define who is who. To find out which one is YOUR father. Anyone who does not practice righteous, was not born again. Was not born of God. And does not have God\u0026rsquo;s seed in him. Same as the one who does not love his brother\n\u0026mdash; END OF PARAPHRASING \u0026mdash; 00:00:00 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/1-john-2-28-3-10/","tags":null,"title":"1 John 2:28-3:10"},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/manifest.json","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.de/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.es/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.fr/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.hi/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.jp/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.nl/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.pl/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.ru/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.zh-cn/","tags":null,"title":""}]
