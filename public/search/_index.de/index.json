[{"categories":null,"content":"Spirit of Truth vs Spirit of Error Intro Our scripture for toady is 1 John chapter 4. And we gonna talk about some things that are not very popular. We gonna talk about spiritual realm a little bit.\nIn today\u0026rsquo;s world many people do not even believe in the reality of the spiritual world. We\u0026rsquo;ve been taught in our schools that in the old days, when people were less knowledgeable and more superstitious. They could not explain why certain things happened, so they came up with idea of unseen power and believe in gods and spirits. But in our day we have science that can explain everything. We do not believe that old stuff anymore. Moreover if you believe in reality of spiritual world, you might be treated as a fool, as ignorant wiredaw. We are taught that only fools believe that.\nAnd because we were taught that, we tend to skip or overlook biblical scriptures which talk about spiritual realm. We treat them as if they were written for the people of the past. Because those people weren\u0026rsquo;t particularly smart, so they needed some sort of explanations, which they would be able to comprehend. And so we, modern, educated people mark those scriptures as irrelevant and outdated, and move on. Often we don\u0026rsquo;t even think twice about it, we skip ahead almost subconsciously.\nIt is very arrogant and altogether the wrong approach. Spiritual world is very real. Always been. But our enemy doesn\u0026rsquo;t want us to believe in spiritual realm. Why?\nJohn 4:24 ²⁴God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”\nGod is spirit, and if spiritual realm does not exist, then God does not exist either. But also, it\u0026rsquo;s a great disguise for the enemy himself. He works against us. And if we reject the very existence of the realm where he operates, it makes his job so much easier. Friends, spiritual world as real today as it were in the day when Jesus waked this earth. And we need to be aware of this. Denying spiritual world makes us venerable. It is like denying viruses. Viruses do not care weather you believe in them or not, you still gonna get affected, you still gonna get sick. Also, by denying spiritual world we essentially denying God.\nSo, before we will proceed to our scriptures for today, first we have to make an agreement. Which is that we, as followers of Christ, believe in spiritual world.\n1 John 4:1-4 ¹Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.²By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,³and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist , which you heard was coming and now is in the world already.\nEarly church believed in spiritual world Existence of spiritual world was not even an issue for the early church. It was a regular part of life. But it\u0026rsquo;s not particularly true for us today. I\u0026rsquo;m not gonna speculate on why. One thing that comes to my mind is that potential cause is our unbelief. We make ourselves deaf and blind to the spiritual realm, because we don\u0026rsquo;t want to see. With that being said, we still might experience an encounter with the spiritual world. And when that happens: when for example we saw a vision, or someone had a word of prophesy for us. Maybe word of knowledge, and etc. There are a lot of \u0026ldquo;options\u0026rdquo;. We get so excited. That we don\u0026rsquo;t even bother asking questions. We forget that it is not only God\u0026rsquo;s spirit, that can interact with us.\n\u0026hellip;do not believe every spirit (verse 1)\nNot every inspiration that comes to us is of Gods spirit. Not every person who claims that God speaks to him, who claims to be, or act as a \u0026ldquo;prophet\u0026rdquo;, is actually of God. Not every person who claims to have a divine knowledge, claims to be used by God, is actually of God. We SHOULD assess whether they are from God or not.\n\u0026hellip;many false prophets have gone out into the world\nThe term \u0026ldquo;prophet\u0026rdquo; is not a very commonly used word anymore, in a minute we will look into what that\u0026rsquo;s mean. But again, If you sitting here thinking it is no longer relevant it belongs to the past. It is not. All this things are true to this day. If nothing else it is more relevant today, because we are so much closer to the end of time, then those who read this letter first.\nWho is prophet? So, who is a \u0026ldquo;prophet\u0026rdquo;?\nGenerally speaking the prophet in Greek writings, is an interpreter of oracles or of other hidden things. The one who speaks by divine inspiration. There were all kinds of people who claimed to be prophets. In our case we can narrow this term to a context of a christian community. So, Prophets that appeared in the apostolic age among Christians are:\nPeople in the assemblies of the Christians, who were moved by the Holy Spirit to speak, having power to instruct, comfort, encourage, rebuke, convict, and stimulate believers.\nGift of prophecy is a beautiful gift, and very helpful for building up the church. Gift of the spirit are real and very, very good and very helpful. Bible says that we SHOULD DESIRE spiritual gifts, especially prophesy.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a great gift for the church to have. Very useful and very powerful. It can help us a ton in our christian journey. But it can also be extremely destructive if we will allow a wrong person to speak into our lives. False prophet can do a great deal of damage to the christian community. Cause all kinds of problems, cause the church to split and etc. There are examples of this. Therefore before we allow the person to speak into our life on behalf of God, before we accept the word that has been spoken, we need to assert weather it actually comes from God.\nSpirit of truth vs spirit of error How can do we make those assertions? Well, there are few things that might help. There are scriptures that helps with that. In our passage for today we are provided with a very reliable approach.\n1 John 4:2,3 ²By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,³and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s break it down.\nTo know the Spirit of God ²By this you know the Spirit of God\u0026hellip;\nOur the most reliable protection layer against false anything is to know the Spirit of God. Maybe you never though of this, but when we receive Holy Spirit, we all receive the same Spirit. Same Spirit dwells in my heart and your heart, not just same kind of spirit, no. One Spirit, abides in you and in me, at the same time.\nIllustration I\u0026rsquo;ll try to give you an illustration. My analogy not the most accurate, but still I think it might help us to understand, at least partially, how that works. When you receive the Holy Spirit it\u0026rsquo;s like getting connected to a water system. When I open my tap at home I get the same water I would get if I would open tap here, at the church. Same water runs in old city, at Orby Towers, at the airport and etc. All our water comes from the same source. When you open your heart for the Holy Spirit, It moves in you as well as in all others who opened their hearts to God. All who is off God, united in and by His spirit.\nSpirit of God works outside of time. Spirit that inspired John to speak and write his letters 2000 years ago, inspired me to speak to you today. Same Spirit inspiring people all over the globe. We all take from the same source. And this source never changes.\nSo by learning how to recognize the Spirit of God we will be empowered to make an assessments of things we sea and hear.\nTrue Jesus \u0026hellip;every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,³and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God.\nI want to pay attention at the verb confesses. In Greek it is homologeō which means:\nto say the same thing as another, i.e. to agree with, assent\nIf we would re-read this part again it would sound like Every spirit that agrees with that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God. Why John is so specific about that? It is clearly not ultimate comprehensive assessments. There are plenty of those who agrees that Jesus \u0026ldquo;came in flesh\u0026rdquo;, as human. But, they are most definitely not off God. What\u0026rsquo;s up with that.\nProblem of the Johns time It will all get cleared in the second. As soon as we will take into account time and situation in which John writes his letter. This is very important when you study, or just read the bible. You cannot ignore the context, otherwise it will lead you into heresy.\nNot a problem today For us today it is not hard to believe in Jesus the man. Historical existence of Jesus is proven. And for vast majority of people is not hard to believe that at some point in the past there were a really good man Jesus. Who was a phenomenal spokesman and impacted the society in a very dramatic way.\nTodays problem For people of our day it is hard to believe in his divine nature. As we mentioned in the beginning a lot of people reject the very existence of spiritual world. Therefore it is hard for them to believe that there is God, and that God became man.\nIssue of the day of John But in the day of John it was almost opposite. For a lot of people it was not too hard to believe that Jesus was God. There were plenty witnesses of his miracles still around. People saw with their very eyes the impossible done by Jesus. But for some people it was hard to believe that he was actually a man. That he had actual body. Those people would say that he was a phantom. That we appeared to have flesh, but it was only illusion.\nFor some people especially with a Greek background it was hard to believe that God can become a man. For them two were incompatible. It went against their view of the world. And instead of submitting, accepting God\u0026rsquo;s truth, they\u0026rsquo;ve tried to fit Jesus into their worldview. This lie started to spread among people. It was easier for some to believe, because it would align with their way of thinking. This false teaching started to creep into churches. It was a big problem. That\u0026rsquo;s why John address this issue very specifically. That\u0026rsquo;s why he says \u0026ldquo;any spirit, to deny Jesus the man is not to be trusted\u0026rdquo;\nTrue Jesus Big underlying issue is when we try to fit bible into our view of the world. When we try to modify what we read about God, Jesus, Holy Spirit to assent with OUR way of thinking.\nWe loose the image of TRUE Jesus. There are communities of such sort, we do not call them churches, because they are not. We have them here in Batumi. Who do not believe TRUE Jesus. Who have their own version. We have individuals who come to our church. Who do not follow same Jesus we follow. They have their own image. Image they created after their own heart.\nThe truth is not in such person. Any such person cannot speak on behalf of God.\nProphesy will agree with God\u0026rsquo;s word Spirit of God will confess, which means - will say the same thing as and agree with Jesus Christ. God is not going to contradict his own word. Whatever revelation, enlightenment, vision or prophesy you\u0026rsquo;ll receive personally or though other people, it should ALWAYS 100% agree with the word of God.\nAny person who claims to speak on God\u0026rsquo;s behalf, anyone who claims the authority to speak into your life should be assayed. Any such person should confess TRUE JESUS. Should submit to Gods word. And not the other way around.\nConclusion Friends, spiritual realm is real. If you discard spiritual world, you cannot worship God in a true fashion, because He is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in the spirit. We should not close our eyes on all things spiritual. But, we also should be careful with what we accept. We should be careful with the things people say on behalf of God. Online, and in person. Especially when someone comes to you with \u0026ldquo;a word from God\u0026rdquo; for you. It is up to you to assess this word according to the bible. And also assay any \u0026ldquo;prophet\u0026rdquo;. Because many false prophets are out in the world.\n00:00:00 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/1-john-4-1-6/","tags":null,"title":"1 John 4 1 6"},{"categories":null,"content":"Born of God To be born of God. This is not how God Calls us Most of us without a doubt will call ourselves \u0026ldquo;Christians\u0026rdquo;. We so used to this name. It is so dear to us and we are so attached to it, that many people almost believe that maybe even Jesus Christ himself secretly started to call his disciples Christians. And it\u0026rsquo;s not a bed name don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong. That\u0026rsquo;s not what I\u0026rsquo;m saying. What I want to say is simply that this is NOT how God calls us.\nOrigin of the name Depending on the context sometimes, it is not all that important. But sometimes the difference is crucial. First of all it was not even disciples or followers who invented the term \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;Christians\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo;. If we would to look into acts 11:25-26. We would see WHEN and WHERE this name takes it\u0026rsquo;s origin:\nActs 11:25,26 ²⁵So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,²⁶and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a great many people. And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians.\nIt was other people who started to call followers of Christ \u0026ldquo;Christians\u0026rdquo;. It started off as a nickname. Like a collective description of the group of people with the same interests. Today we call some groups like Rednecks, Nerds, Christians\u0026hellip;\nTerm \u0026ldquo;Christians\u0026rdquo; in the modern days In the modern day a lot of people consider themselves Christians for a variety of different reasons. In countries with a strong cultural bond, like Georgia. People often say something among the lines: \u0026ldquo;My parents were Christians, and grandparents were Christians, therefore I\u0026rsquo;m a Christians\u0026rdquo;. In minds of many to be Georgian is to be Christian. It\u0026rsquo;s not exclusive to Georgia, there are other nations like that. Because, Christianity in their mind is a part of their cultural heritage. It\u0026rsquo;s a tradition. Just a title. Often it has very little to do with the faith and lifestyle.\nAll together, it is not very reliable term this days. This world called us Christians. But, God gave us the other name. There is a biblical concept that does way better job in defining who is who.And that is To be born of God.\nBorn of God. Introduction Jesus introduced the idea that you should be born again. Born from the spirit. When he talked to Nicodemus. Who was the teacher of the law and one of his(Jesus\u0026rsquo;s) secret followers.\nJohn 3:3,5 ”³Jesus answered him(Nicodemus), “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.”⁴Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother\u0026rsquo;s womb and be born?”⁵Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God\n1 John elaborates on this In his letter John repeats and elaborates on this. He says: \u0026ldquo;we are God\u0026rsquo;s Children NOW\u0026rdquo; In the verse 1. We already talked about it a little bit last Sunday. God loved us so much, that he not only took away our sin. But he also, made us a part of His family. How great is that? In the verse 9 we get a bit more explanation. We can see more connection with what Jesus were saying to Nicodemus:\n1 John 3:9 ⁹ No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God\u0026rsquo;s seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God.\nToday I want us to pay closer attention to this two statements:\nHe(the person) Has been born of God God\u0026rsquo;s seed abides in him(person) This two statements are very important. We not gonna be able to cover their meaning in full today. There is not enough nether time, nor the knowledge, that I poses. But, nevertheless we will shed some light on it.\nNot yet transformed, but already children In verse 2 John saying that we already are Children of God.\n1 John 3:2 ²Beloved, we are God\u0026rsquo;s children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is.\nWe still to undergo some major transformation. We will receive new glorified body, like one Jesus have. There are few places in the new testament which talk about this. I can share a list with you if you want to read more about it. As for now we will briefly read one scripture to give you an idea if you have never heard of it yet.\nPhilippians 3:20,21 ²⁰But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,²¹who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.\nIt is an interesting topic but it is outside of our scope for tonight. The main point that I want to emphasize is that, despite that we are still in our old bodies, which suffer from diseases \u0026amp; fleshly desires we ALREADY ARE children of God. When we come to God. When we confess our sins. When we !GENUINELY repent and accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior. We receive Holy Spirit and we get BORN AGAIN - experience radical transformation in our relationship with God. We become children of God.\nForeigners in this world When we get born again, we die for this world. We become foreigners. Verse 1 says that this world does not know us. That\u0026rsquo;s because when we die(figuratively speaking) for this wold, we broke that intimate bond, that deep relational connection with the worldly system. It cannot recognize us anymore. We start to belong to a different kingdom. And we cannot be a part of both.\nThere is a key difference that separates us, makes us incompatible with this worldly system. We change our citizenship, change our status. We get reborn and God\u0026rsquo;s seed abides in us now.\nUnderstanding seed It is very important to truly understand what that mean. This word SEED is an interesting word. Widely used in agriculture and biology. Seed is something that produces new life. Produces offspring.\nSame type of species As you know I\u0026rsquo;m not too much into agriculture and biology. But one thing that I know it that seeds always produce same type of species. You can\u0026rsquo;t grow banana trees from apple seeds. Mountain lions don\u0026rsquo;t give birth to monkeys. And the same among the humans. We are very much like our parents. Weather we like it or not, when we conceived we inevitably inherit some core characteristics of our parents. Their seed abides in us.\nI tried to be not like my dad My childhood was not a \u0026ldquo;bed of roses\u0026rdquo;. In my teenage age i decided that I don\u0026rsquo;t want to have anything to do with my dad. And I would meticulously get rid of any similarities, weather it is a way of talking, some behavioral patterns, anything that I could spot. And you know what? I didn\u0026rsquo;t succeed very much. I thought I did, but I was wrong. Once I got old enough I realized that unconsciously I\u0026rsquo;m actually a lot like my father. Because, his seed is in me. There is no way around it.\nSpiritual rebirth When we get born of God. We experience this rebirth in our spirit. It\u0026rsquo;s not just words. It\u0026rsquo;s a fact that we accept by faith. You might not feel anything physically at first. But it shows through. This radical change in our relation to God cannot go unseen. There will be some noticeable changes.\n1 John 3:4-9 ⁴Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.⁵You know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.⁶No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him.⁷Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.⁸ Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.⁹ No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God\u0026rsquo;s seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God.\nAttitude to sin. Lawlessness First noticeable difference is that our attitude to sin changes. In verse 4 we read that sin is lawlessness, and to practice sin is to practice lawlessness. Let\u0026rsquo;s break this down:\nTo practice lawlessness means to regularly or intentionally engage in actions that disregard or violate laws, rules, or norms. It implies a consistent habit or behavior of acting without respect for the authority.\nIn other words it means that those who are sinning disregard God\u0026rsquo;s law, and therefore disregard God, the one who created the law.\nTo disregard someone - means to ignore them, treat them as unimportant, or show a lack of consideration or respect for them. It involves not acknowledging their feelings, opinions, or presence.\nLove vs Disregard. Make practice of sinning You don\u0026rsquo;t treat anyone you love in this fashion. Maybe we can even argue that love and disregard are opposite to each other. And this is perfect description of how people of this world live their lives. They do not consider God. His feelings, opinions or presence. They make practice of sinning and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t bother them a bit.\nWe were just like that. Once we were just like that. We loved to sin. We were proud of our sins. Maybe we would even compete with our friend who would take it further. We made plans to sin. We would reflect on our past sins with a great satisfaction. We used to find great pleasure and comfort in our sins.\nThis is regular state of mind, state of heart of someone who is, as John says, of the devil. If you love sin, then devil is your father.\n1 John 3:8 ⁸ Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.\nHabitual sin vs occasional Again, I will repeat myself and say that we are not talking about occasional sin. We all sin time to time. And John addresses it in the very beginning of his letter.\n1 John 1:8 ⁸ If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\nNo, in out today\u0026rsquo;s passage we talk about people who love to sin. Who is not bothered by it. Who chose sin as their lifestyle. Who finds pleasure, enjoys their sins and plan to continue. As verse 8 says people who make a practice of sinning or as the other translation says who love to sin. Such people are of the devil. That\u0026rsquo;s the people of this worldly system. They are not of God. Any such person never seen or knew God according to the Bible.\n1 John 3:9 ⁹ No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God\u0026rsquo;s seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God.\nWe inherit from God When we born of God. Once His seed start to abide in us. We become new creatures. We inherit our father\u0026rsquo;s characteristics. And since he hates sin. We start to hate sin too. It is not about our will power or something. No, it becomes our nature.\nMe and Ales For example I like to rules. Let\u0026rsquo;s say we are playing a board game. I really dislike when people break the rules. It bothers me a lot. Also, I have a son(more then one actually). And you know what? My son, big surprise, is just as much into rules as I am, in not more. How much will power, of effort it took him to become like his father? Maybe he spent years training himself to like rules? No, he just inherit it from his parents. My seed abides in him\nSummery So, as John says\n1 John 3:7 ⁷Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.\n1 John 3:3 ³And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.\n1 John 3:9 ⁹ No one born of God makes a practice of sinning\u0026hellip;\n1 John 3:10 ¹⁰By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother.\nChildren of God In his letter to the church. On one hand John explains who are the true Children of God. Again and again he repeats and expands our view. Like a ripple on the water. We start at the core, and step by step expand our understanding.\nDeceivers On the other had he warns us about deceivers. False brothers who will try to lead us away from the truth. They can be still inside our church, in our mids, but also outside. Especially in our days of fast internet and countless hours of sermons and teachings available online. The goal of deceivers is to make you go astray. Be very very, extremely careful of what you listen too, because sure there are a lot of good material our there. But there is a lot of a false teaching as well. The most dangerous kind, which sounds alright for the most part. But as they say, the devil is in the details.\nLair The devil is ultimate lair. He perfected his art of deceiving. He will do what it takes to make you doubt God. Make you doubt yourself. To make you loose the joy of your salvation.\nDo not let devil to deceive you. If we adhere to this 4 principles:\nWe Don\u0026rsquo;t love sin We Love our brothers We Practice righteousness We Purify ourselves Then you can be sure that God\u0026rsquo;s seed abides in you. You\u0026rsquo;ve been born of God. YOU ARE the child of God who was born from death to life.\nPrayer If you unsure if ever experienced this radical Transformation in our relationship with God. If you still don\u0026rsquo;t find this 4 principles to be part of your life yet, but you want to change. You can come up to me after the service and we will pray together.(Or any other prayer that you need)\nTo be born of God: To have God\u0026rsquo;s seed =\u0026gt; to be like father. Righteous Sinless Pure Loving To have hope to be transformed. (Glorified body?) Pass From Death To Life Love Brothers Practically. Not by word but by work.

The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. ²Beloved, we are God\u0026rsquo;s children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. ³And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.\n⁴Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. ⁵You know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. ⁶No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. ⁷Little children, let no one deceive you.

He reminds us about the time of his coming.\n1 John 2:28 ²⁸And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he appears we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at his coming.\nThe context for this verse is right about it. Last Sunday we gave a good look at those verses. Where John warns against false brothers \u0026amp; Antichrists. Those who once was in the fellowship, but rejected Jesus and left the church. John tells us that not all who once \u0026ldquo;knew Jesus\u0026rdquo; will have confidence at his coming. As followers of Jesus Christ, we should anticipate His coming and rejoice about Him. But, some people not gonna be happy at all. We not talking about those who do not know Christ, the unbelievers. No, in this particular scripture we talk only about those who was a part of the church and left due to some wrong believes.\nJohn writes about those who, not only fell for a false believes, but also were trying to deceive people in the church. Reality is that all kinds of false, pseudo Christ teachings exist out there. From the beginning enemy tries to deceive people by twisting Gods word, by whispering into peoples minds. And as we said last week some people more prone to that. They can\u0026rsquo;t comprehend how simple the Gospel is. They are looking for something move advanced. And event though Bible has the depth, that we yet to uncover, in the pursue of the sacred knowledge, people OFTEN get off track. Others, get overwhelmed with their own pride, and believe that THEY have been trusted with a NEW revelation. That angels or probably God himself reveled that secret truth to them. Then Bible gets discarded as legacy and outdated source. And people start to move \u0026ldquo;by spirit\u0026rdquo;. Every cult, sect, or a false teaching started in a very similar fashion.\nGW probably are in the park right at this moment. Recently we\u0026rsquo;ve had some Mormon visitors in our church. And over the years serving to this very fellowship we\u0026rsquo;ve heard all kinds of wired and plainly non biblical theologies from people who came to church on weekly bases. I mean this stuff is real to this day. Even when people are not a part of a particular false teaching stream. They can still live in delusion about their false believes.\nLike a person who is slowly loosing the eyesight. Often they genuinely believe that their vision is good. For example my oldest son. He argued with me when I took him to get his vision checked. He were claiming that his vision is very much perfect. He was getting angry that we(parents) do not agree. But then, when he actually got the glasses. When he looked though them for the first time. He was amazed. He were been looking around, standing in the awe of the beauty of the world around him. He got back something he didn\u0026rsquo;t know he lost. Because vision goes down slowly, gradually. So smoothly that you don\u0026rsquo;t even notice that you see less and less. For us, his parents, it was somewhat obvious that our son don\u0026rsquo;t see as good as we do. But him, in that moment he was convinced that WE are wrong, and he is wright. He knows what he is talking about. He knows the truth.\nSame can happen to us. We can start loosing our spiritual vision. Slowly, gradually. It would get worse and worse, and we can fall for some lies that exist out there. Without realizing it. We would think that WE are right, WE clearly see the path. When in reality we already almost blind, and wondering in the darkness. That\u0026rsquo;s why it is important to stay connected. To belong to a church, to a fellowship of believers. To have people who can speak into your life, people that you will actually listen too. We have many people who are temporally stay here in Batumi. Who came here for a short time and then the go further. But, even in this circumstances you SHOULD belong. If not a permanent part of any church. You are in big danger. If this is you, you should reconsider your attitude, because it\u0026rsquo;s not a God\u0026rsquo;s will. And most likely pride starts to take over.\nWrong ideas \u0026amp; theologies, false teachings had always been around. Trying to snick into your heart and soul. It is like an infection, like a parasite that can kill you. But John gives us an ultimate cure. Natural remedy that will take care of all our spiritual inflammations. Abide in Him. As simple as that.\nAbide to have confidence and not shirk from him in shame when he comes.\nJesus is coming back Jesus is coming back. Bible is clear that this day will come and we not gonna know when it will happen. There is no way to know when you will meet the Lord. Jesus says:\nMatthew 25:13,14 ¹³ Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why it is important to be always ready. So that you can have confidence. Like a good kid, who does what he should and obey his parent. He is not concerned about when parents are coming home. He is confident, he knows that he not gonna get in trouble.\nTo be completely honest, I was not always like that as the kid. Me and my friends did all kinds of stupid things while our parents wasn\u0026rsquo;t home. Things I knew I\u0026rsquo;m not allowed to do. And I can tell you, I WAS very concerned and very worried about my parents coming back home early.\nNow, we are children of God, who happened to be \u0026ldquo;home alone\u0026rdquo; so to speak. And we are waiting for our Master to come back. And how we gonna feel at his return is up to us. For example at the end of his life apostle Paul says:\n2 Timothy 4:7,8 ⁷ I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. ⁸Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing.\nPaul had confidence that he not only will be with the Lord, but also, that God will be very pleased with him. Not only he kept the faith, but he also fought a good fight, finished the race.\nUnfortunately not all of us will be like apostle Paul. It is very possible for a person to start his journey well, and drift away later. We can see examples of this from the beginning. In the garden of Eden. Adam and Eve knew God. Once they had fellowship with Him and had no fear. But then, when they broke his word their attitude have changed:\nGenesis 3:8-13 \u0026hellip;⁸And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God\u0026hellip;\nThey had no confidence. They were afraid. They were not exited about the Lord\u0026rsquo;s coming. Like a naughty kids, they were ashamed and frightened. They suddenly realized that they didn\u0026rsquo;t do what they were supposed to. The same will be on the day when Jesus will come back. Some people, who once followed Him, will be ashamed. They will shirk from him in shame.\nBut it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be this way. It is up to us how we gonna meet the Lord, because God already did everything possible on His side of things.\nChildren Of God 1 John 3:1-3 ¹See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him.²Beloved, we are God\u0026rsquo;s children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is.³And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.\nOur Heavenly Father went above and beyond in his mission to save us from our sins. Not only our penalty got nullified, but also we were privileged to become children of God. He merged us into His family. And it is not just a promise of something that will happen in the future. No, it was already done.\nIn Jesus we find something greater then just a reset to the default settings. You know whey your device get\u0026rsquo;s really messed up. Nothing working and seems like there is no way to fix it. There is a last resort. Reset to default settings. It will cancel out all the changes that led your device to a poor condition.\nSometime we look at work of Jesus from the same perspective. That when Jesus died on the cross, he did a \u0026ldquo;global reset\u0026rdquo;. And now we are back to a \u0026ldquo;Garden of Eden\u0026rdquo; settings. But it is not exactly true. Adam was never part of God\u0026rsquo;s family. But through Jesus, God makes us his children. Not just servants or slaves, but children. It is unbelievable privilege. I think many of us hear this words so often that we kinda don\u0026rsquo;t hear them anymore. You know, when you hear something many, many times at some point it just turns into a white noise. Something on the background that you don\u0026rsquo;t even think about.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s think about this for a moment. It\u0026rsquo;s not just a nickname or a label. No, it is our new status. It is totally different kind of relationship.\nWhen we come to God. When we get born again, born of the spirit. We get born as God\u0026rsquo;s children. John says that we are God\u0026rsquo;s children now. We still in our old body. We still wrestle with our old sinful desires somewhat. But, we already are God\u0026rsquo;s children. We die for this worldly system. And born again to be children of God.\nWe find confirmation to this in that \u0026ldquo;the world doesn\u0026rsquo;t know us\u0026rdquo; anymore.\n\u0026hellip;The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. John says.\nI want us to have a closer look at the verb TO KNOW. It get used very often. Especially lately when we talk about knowing God. Or about world knowing us. I think we don\u0026rsquo;t perceive this word the same way it used in the Greek.\nIn original text γινώσκω (ginṓskō) - means \u0026ldquo;to know\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;to recognize\u0026rdquo;. But in opposition to a modern view of this word. In Greek it often goes beyond simple intellectual knowledge. It typically implies a deeper, more intimate understanding, experience, or relationship. In biblical context, ginṓskō often points to a type of knowing that involves relationship, intimacy, and understanding on a deeper, experiential level.\nWorldly system doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand us, doesn\u0026rsquo;t love us. Because, it does not understand and does not love God. Once we become God\u0026rsquo;s children we quit been children of this world. We become foreigners. We break this intimate connection with world. We die to this world. And we born again for God.\n\u0026mdash; CUT \u0026mdash;\n1 John 3:4-10 ⁴Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. ⁵You know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. ⁶No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. ⁷Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous. ⁸ Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. ⁹ No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God\u0026rsquo;s seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God. ¹⁰By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother.\nThere is a lot to unpack in this chunk. We will omit some of the thing for now, to make sure we stay focused. When we get born again God\u0026rsquo;s seed start to abide in us. It will relentlessly cause changes in us. Because all species are reflection of their parents. You can\u0026rsquo;t grow banana trees out of apple seeds. Apple seed produce apple trees. African babies, do not get born in let\u0026rsquo;s say Korian families, if they do, it raises a lot of questions. We all bear seed of our parents.\nWe know that there is no sin in God. That Jesus came to take away sins. So, the one who is born of God do not make practice of sin. We make practice of righteousness instead. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you will not ever sin again. We are not yet perfect, so we will fail. But you do not choose sin as a lifestyle. You do not plan on sinning. You do not \u0026ldquo;make practice\u0026rdquo; of sin.\nThis is how we know who is of God and who is of the devil. Sin - is the seed of the evil one. John says he was sinning form the beginning. So, therefore whoever make practice of sin is the son of the devil. Such person is the reflection of his father.\nThis world and people of this world try to confuse us with their clever talk. With their wisdom. Which often might sound resalable. But as John says don\u0026rsquo;t let anyone to confuse you:\nWe have the message we received from the beginning. Gospel of Jesus Christ. Today we are blessed to have a written word of God. And it is sufficient. If anyone says - Gospel is not enough to get saved - they are deceived. Same as those who say you do not need Gospel, or Jesus. There are a lot of liers out there who will tell you:\n\u0026ldquo;If have a decease, you are not born again because\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If you are not rich you are not born again because\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Christianity is ok but you are not real believer until you do X\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;etc\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nJohn says:\n\u0026ldquo;abide in his word and you will have confidence\u0026rdquo;\neveryone who practices righteousness has been born of him.\neveryone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure\neveryone practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.\nWe will have confidence on the day of his coming if we are born again. When we get born again we die for this world and become a babies in God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom. We carry God\u0026rsquo;s seed in us, and that makes us more like our father. And who is our father get evident by what we do. Children of God abide in his word and do his works. Children of devil abide in his word and do his works.\nLook at your life. If you live a lifestyle of sin. You need to get born again. As Jesus says:\nJohn 3:5-6 ”⁵Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.⁶ That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.\nIf you live a lifestyle of obedience to the God\u0026rsquo;s word. If you hate sin, and love your brothers. You are on the right track. You can have confidence. And it is important to preserve this confidence till the end. So that we can be like apostle Paul and others. And for that we need one another. For that reason God build his church.\n00:00:00 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/1-john-2-28-3-10/","tags":null,"title":"1 John 2:28-3:10"},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/manifest.json","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.de/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.es/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.fr/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.hi/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.jp/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.nl/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.pl/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.ru/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.zh-cn/","tags":null,"title":""}]
