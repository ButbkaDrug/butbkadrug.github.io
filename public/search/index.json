[{"categories":null,"content":"INRO Greeting brothers and sisters, we are back to our regular study. To the book of Romans. And at this point we are on the finish line. There are about 1,5 chapters left. And today we going to continue with the chapter 15.\nLast time we studied Romans on Thanksgiving. Right before we had a \u0026ldquo;Christmas break\u0026rdquo;. But no we\u0026rsquo;re back! We stopped at the verse 20. So, today we will pick up from there.\nBut before we will read our scripture for today, let\u0026rsquo;s rewind a few verses back where apostle Paul explains His role in God\u0026rsquo;s plan. Providing some more reasons why he have written this letter. And very importantly what gave him the authority to speak into the life of that church.\nBecause remember, Paul did not established church in Rome. In fact he have never visited them. So, even though Paul was quite famous and controversial figure in Christian circles of the first century. He was not a part of that church. In a way he was a stranger. I think many have heard about him. But as for the church he was an outsider.\nSo, Paul writes this:\nRomans 15:15,16 ¹⁵But I have written very boldly to you on some points so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given to me from God,¹⁶to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering as a priest the gospel of God\u0026hellip;, so that my offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.\nPaul was a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. He had a unique role. He was appointed personally by Jesus Christ. He had a special mission and responsibility. To bring the Gospel of Christ to the Gentiles(non Jewish people). And authority that he had was unique to Him.\nUnlike regular pastor of the church. When your authority AND responsibility bound by the very concrete group of people that God trusted you with. Paul\u0026rsquo;s authority and responsibility stretched over ALL gentiles. Across multiple churches. It was also backed by the power of the Holy Spirit. Which is very important.\nRomans 15:19 ¹⁹in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit; so that from Jerusalem and all around as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.\nPaul presents the fruit of his ministry. Proof of his validity. Proof that he is a real deal. That God is with Him.\nThis verification was necessary. Because in a new testament time, and it is still true to this day, there were a lot of false teachers, false prophets, self proclaimed leaders etc.\nPeople who cover up their hidden motives with Christian appearance. People ho have their own ambitions, agenda. Who pursue their won gals. Who try to use the church of God for their own purposes.\nJesus Himself warns us about it:\nMatthew 7:15-18,20 ¹⁵“Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.¹⁶You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes, nor figs from thistles, are they?¹⁷So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.¹⁸A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.²⁰So then, you will know them by their fruits.\nPeople can fool you and me. They can fake christian character. So much so that you cannot tell who is who until you see the fruit. The results of their work.\nAnd this is real. Even in our own church we already experienced that. When people come, they smile into your face. They say nice things, presenting the best version of themselves in public. On Sundays, during the small groups throughout the week.\nThey know all the right words. Know all the right answers. Can quote scriptures upon scriptures. And you look at them and think\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, this person way better them me. I don\u0026rsquo;t know bible nearly as well. I have issues with my character. But this guy/girl is perfect. Perfect follower of Christ. How come you are not the pastor or something\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nBut then\u0026hellip; At the same time this people engage in behind-the-scenes maneuvering to achieve their own goals. To satisfy their ego. Or I don\u0026rsquo;t even know what.\nThey go around approaching people in private saying things like \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s start our own church. This guys don\u0026rsquo;t know what they are doing. They are too this, they are too that\u0026hellip; Church should be this. Church should be that\u0026hellip;This church missing this and that\u0026hellip; They don\u0026rsquo;t let people serve and etc.\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a real problem that still exist. Maybe it is happening right now. I\u0026rsquo;m not gonna know. They not going to come to me. They gonna come to you.\nIt is especially challenging in the setting like ours. When we have new people joining our fellowship every week. On one hand you want to encourage people to serve, to edify one another. And on the other hand you want to prevent \u0026ldquo;ravenous wolves\u0026rdquo;, as Jesus called them, from having a go.\nBack to Paul So, even though apostle Paul was very famous figure. For this particular church he was an outsider.\nHe did not hesitate to provide a prove that his motivation is pure. That he have authority given by God. That he CAN BE TRUSTED. And all he says is to help the Church to excel. To be the church God want\u0026rsquo;s them to be. All that he says add\u0026rsquo;s value. Builds up.\nHe did that by presenting the fruit of His work up to that moment. Second half of the verse 19:\nRomans 15:19 ¹⁹\u0026hellip;from Jerusalem and all around as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.\nAnd then he says following:\nRomans 15:20-24 ²⁰And in this way I aspired to preach the gospel, not where Christ was already known by name, so that I would not build on another person’s foundation;²¹but just as it is written:\n“THEY WHO HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD ABOUT HIM WILL SEE, AND THEY WHO HAVE NOT HEARD WILL UNDERSTAND.”\n²²For this reason I have often been prevented from coming to you;²³but now, with no further place for me in these regions, and since I have had for many years a longing to come to you²⁴whenever I go to Spain—for I hope to see you in passing, and to be helped on my way there by you\u0026hellip;\nHe explains why he have never visited them. And now, even though he counts on their financial support to continue his ministry in Spain, he is not after money.\nPaul in his letter openly shares all his concerns, suggestions and expectation. Advice and etc.\nFirst of all he have authority to do that. As we could see. And also he did things right way. Which is an example for us to follow.\nApplication? There is no place for plotting, \u0026ldquo;pulling the strings\u0026rdquo; so to speak, in the Church. Church is not the place for trying to \u0026ldquo;Wheel a deal\u0026rdquo;.\nIf you have genuine concerns go the leaders. Go to a pastor and present them there. Openly. Start praying about it. It does work.\nBut If instead you are going around the church sabotaging the work of God. Please, Stop. You are not serving the Lord. You gonna summon the wrath of God on yourself. Please, go do something else. There are plenty of things to be busy with.\nIf someone coming to you and start to make you doubt your church. Leaders, pastor whatever. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to listen to that.\nI really liked the response of one of the people who had experienced that situation few years ago. He said:\n\u0026ldquo;If you have real concerns. Let\u0026rsquo;s go to the pastor together and talk them through\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nDon\u0026rsquo;t let seeds of the doubt to grow in your heart. This is how the enemy work. Right from the beginning. When someone comes to you and tries to makes you to doubt your faith, your church, your church leaders. They are not concerned about you. They have their own agenda in doing so. It is not the God\u0026rsquo;s way of doing things. This is how the enemy works.\nRemember, by their fruit you\u0026rsquo;ll know them.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/romans-15-20-33/","tags":null,"title":"Romans 15:20-33"},{"categories":null,"content":"INTRO Good evening, friends. If you are new here, my name is Viktar. It is an honor and a privilege for me to be with you tonight.\nI promise I will not take too long, so we can continue our celebration.\nWe have been preparing for this day for a while now. We put a lot of thought and effort into it. We decorated our hall. We prepared musical pieces for our little concert. We prepared presents for our friends and family at home.\nFor many of us, the Christmas season is a very busy time. It can be stressful as well.\nSo now, I would really like us to take a moment, slow down a little. Bringing our attention back to the core — the very reason for this celebration.\nQ: What do you mean by going back to the core?\nWell…\nChristmas, as we know it today, is actually quite new. Only about 100 years ago, Christmas took the form we all know. It became widely celebrated, even among non-religious people.\nAnd this was not the result of a great revival or spiritual awakening. It was not about people coming back to God. Back to the Bible. No. None of that. It had nothing to do with faith in God.\nThe Christmas revolution, if you will, had much more pragmatic reasons.\nFor the most part, big companies and stores simply wanted to sell more products. You can read about it online. But a simplified version would sound like this:\nUntil 1900, Christmas was about remembering Christ’s birth. Families gathered, prayed, shared simple meals, and focused on gratitude, love, and generosity.\nBut after the 1930s, when Santa Claus came around, everything changed.\nChristmas became more about shopping, gifts, decorations, and sales. The focus shifted to spending money, meeting expectations, and creating a “perfect” holiday.\nChristmas is no longer centered around Jesus. Christmas without Christ is a reality for many people. A lot of people in this world, in this very city, will soon celebrate Christmas. Whether it is on the 25th of December or the 7th of January.\nWe will decorate our houses. We will put up our Christmas trees. We will cook special food and buy presents. We will invite our friends and family. We will celebrate! But how many of us will celebrate Jesus?\nPreparing for story\u0026hellip; Here at Calvary Chapel, we believe in Jesus. God who came down to earth. He is our Lord and Savior. And this is not just words. We are not about being religious. We pursue a living faith.\nThat is why we should take Christmas seriously. And not just rush through this season, using it as an excuse to treat ourselves and our loved ones to something special.\nStory? Imagine your wife\u0026rsquo;s birthday is coming up.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;ll be like, \u0026ldquo;Honey, it\u0026rsquo;s your birthday! This is so cool. Finally! I\u0026rsquo;ve been counting the days! You must be so happy! I am sooooo happpppyyy!!!\u0026rdquo;\nYou know what I did this year? Because I love you so much, I decided to treat myself. I bought a new phone, a new gaming console, and new set of fishing rods! Isn\u0026rsquo;t that the best day ever? I\u0026rsquo;ve been saving all year.\nAlso, hun, I\u0026rsquo;ll go bowling with my buddies. They suggested going to a restaurant afterwards, and I think I\u0026rsquo;ll join. It\u0026rsquo;s your birthday after all! It should be special. It should create memories.\nnew phone rings\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, guys are already here to pick me up\u0026rdquo;\nOkay. I gotta go. Have a good one.\nBye!\n\u0026hellip; Love you! \u0026hellip;\nConnection First of all, this is NOT marital advice. Please don\u0026rsquo;t try this at home. Otherwise, you risk creating memories you will never forget indeed.\nAs weird as this example is, this is exactly how many people celebrate Christmas, paying no attention to Jesus and focusing entirely on themselves.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why, for the last few weeks, we\u0026rsquo;ve been talking about Jesus’ birth. We looked at the birth of Christ as a message of peace, joy, and hope for all people, reflecting on the true meaning of Christmas, which is about the Savior being born.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve been lighting up these candles every time we discover one of these topics because\u0026hellip; Well, mostly because it looks cool and kids love it :) There is nothing secret or sacred about these candles. So, without further ado, let\u0026rsquo;s light up our last candle, which is the candle of love.\nMessage of Love John 3:16 ¹⁶“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.\nThe birth of Jesus is the message of God’s love to people. Yes, Jesus came to save us. But he also came to teach us about love. To show us what God is like. That he is a loving Father. He is love.\nJesus was born because \u0026ldquo;God so loved the world\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; In other words, God loved me and you so much that he decided to step in and save us. So that we would have eternal life.\nThis shows us God’s attitude towards us. And it is love all the way. He loves us so much more than we can imagine. Definitely more than we deserve.\nApplication God so loved you that he gave his only Son, so that you would not perish but have eternal life. Think about it… Isn\u0026rsquo;t it beautiful?\nNotice that all the effort is on God’s side. All the benefits are on your side. How is it possible? It is hard to believe. Hard to accept.\nWe tend to think we should do something to earn God’s love and favor. We should prove we deserve it. If we were good people, followed all the rules, and all that, maybe then we would believe…\nBecause we are so used to \u0026ldquo;selfish\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;self-centered\u0026rdquo; love, which, one way or another, still seeks to receive. Even when giving away.\nThere are so few examples of true \u0026ldquo;selfless\u0026rdquo; love in our world today. That makes it hard for us to accept the \u0026ldquo;selfless\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;unconditional\u0026rdquo; love of God.\nThe birth of Jesus is the greatest gift for you and me. God gave us his Son so that through Him we would be adopted into His family.\nAgain, all the work is on God’s side, and all the benefits are on our side.\nWhy? - Because God so loved the world.\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;Jesus revealed the heart of God the Father in sending God the Son; to bring salvation — rescue, hope, healing — to the world through Him.\u0026rdquo; - David Guzik\nToday I want to invite you to ponder this and reflect on God’s love during the Christmas season.\nJohn 3:16 ¹⁶“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.\nAnd if you want to know more about God’s love, if the phrase \u0026ldquo;personal relationship with God\u0026rdquo; is not something that applies to your life but you wish it did, you can come and talk to me afterwards.\nFor now, let\u0026rsquo;s say a couple of words in prayer, expressing our gratitude for the love of God given to us.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/christmass-2025/","tags":null,"title":"Christmass 2025"},{"categories":null,"content":"START Greetings, church. We are 10 days away from Christmas—it’s coming fast. Today we are going to continue reflecting on the birth of Christ. It’s time to light our second candle and talk about joy.\n\u0026hellip;\nI want to start with a question: what is joy?\n\u0026hellip;\nWhen you hear the word joy, what comes to your mind?\n\u0026hellip;\nFor me, it would be words like happiness, laughter, smiles… and those are all good words. When we hear joy, or to be joyful, many of us immediately think about happiness, or being happy. A state when everything goes well. When everything is right. For me, as well as for many other people, joy and happiness are interchangeable terms—two ways to say the same thing.\nNow… you probably already know this, but I was surprised to learn that happiness and joy are NOT in fact the same thing — at least from a biblical point of view.\nHappiness is our reaction to circumstances and external events.\nA reaction to things going well.\nHappiness You buy something at a much lower price — you feel happy. You receive a gift — you feel happy. You catch a fish or fix something. Or you pay your bills and, despite all odds, still have money left in your wallet — nothing makes you happier than that. Whatever it might be, it’s good circumstances that trigger a positive reaction. That’s what we understand by being happy. But because it’s only a reaction, it is fully dependent on the situation and circumstances.\nDifference Happiness can be momentary. You can feel happy for a brief moment — for a few minutes, a couple of hours — but overall still live in depression, misery, or apathy. It is only when something very good happens that you experience this spike in happiness, which quickly dies down.\nIn other words happiness - it\u0026rsquo;s when the source of your joy is external.\nIt’s like relying on rain as a source of drinking water. You have no control over it. Your life is fully at the mercy of the weather. And sometimes our life can be like the rainforests of Adjara — where it rains hard almost every day.\nNIKO AT HALA Once we did the first day of our NIKO camp in the Mtirala rainforest during the rainy season. NIKO is a kind of extreme camp — you could even say it’s somewhat like a boot camp. There are a lot of challenges, both physical and mental, with plenty of hiking and all that. Basically, rain is not something we worry about at all at NIKO camps. In fact, we actually pray for rain on at least some days of the camp to add more drama to the challenges you’re going through.\nBut that time in Mtirala, it was different. It was raining — actually, we got so much rain, you couldn’t even imagine. It was literally a wall of rain all day long. You got wet immediately unless you hid somewhere. The rain made so much noise that you had to shout right into the ear of the person next to you if you wanted to be heard.\nWe couldn’t do anything. We were hours behind schedule because it rained so hard. Little rivers appeared out of nowhere and flowed around us. It was impossible to continue our program because of how much rain there was.\nCONNECTION And if we are at such a stage of life when everything goes well, you have more than enough reasons to be happy. You might think there’s no problem — who cares about digging a well when you get so much rain!\nWe might think we are in no need of the fullness of joy — that momentary happiness is good enough. We can live happily without God. Or most likely, we simply don’t think about it at all. We feel happy — who cares where it’s coming from?\nDue to the abundance of rain, relying on it doesn’t seem to be an issue. You might think, “What’s the big deal? I have plenty of water anyway.”\nOUR LIFE NOT A RAIN FOREST Unfortunately, for most of us, life is not a rainforest — at least not for very long. I know some of us today are lacking in the happiness department, feeling apathy, indifference, maybe even depression. More often, life feels like a desert rather than a rainforest.\nOr maybe we just don’t have anything to collect the water with. So even when it rains, you just stand there with your mouth open, trying to catch as many drops as possible, hoping it will satisfy your thirst. It’s not a very effective strategy — believe me, I’ve tried. It’s not going to work.\nFor the vast majority of people, relying on rain is simply not an option. Just like we can’t live without water, we cannot live without joy. And just as rain cannot fulfill our need for fresh drinking water, momentary happiness is not going to be enough.\nJoy On the other hand, we have joy, which, although not the opposite of happiness, is still different. It has a deeper meaning. Fullness of joy, as it is described in the Bible, is an enduring state that persists regardless of whether circumstances are good or bad.\nUnlike the momentary nature of happiness that this world has to offer, the joy that comes from God is constant. Feeling happy depends on ever-changing circumstances, but joy is permanent and does not depend on the situation. Joy is superior in every way, and it is a free gift that comes from God.\nLuke 2:10 ¹⁰And so the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the people;\nThe joy of God is inclusive. It is for ALL PEOPLE. It is available for you and me — no credit card required! All you need is written in John 7:38.\nJohn 7:38 ³⁸The one who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.’ ”\nIt’s about the change that happens in you. It starts with repentance. You cannot experience the fullness of joy that comes from God until you reconcile with Him. Fullness of joy comes through the work of the Holy Spirit in us.\nMomentary happiness is not meant to last. Just like rain, it comes and goes—like that brief spike of a nice feeling in the darkness of your life.\nFullness of joy is different. It is enduring and persistent — like a water spring. It’s always flowing. It’s not a short-lived flash of light that brightens the darkness for a brief second. It’s like turning on a light, casting out the darkness from your life.\nJohn 15:11 ¹¹These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you, and that your joy may be made full.\nWhen we receive HIS joy, we don’t have to rely on external circumstances anymore. Our joy becomes complete — made full. We don’t have to rely on the rain because we have an unlimited source of living water right within us, always at hand, so to speak.\nDOESN\u0026rsquo;T MEAN NO SORROW Fullness of joy does not mean that from now on we will never, ever be sad again. No — unfortunately, we still live in a broken world. There are times for grief and sadness, times to weep with those who weep, and all that. It is only at the end of time that all suffering will pass away.\nRevelation 21:4 ⁴and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away.”\nIn the future, we will have no reason to be sad. But meanwhile, even when you have the fullness of joy, you can still feel sad — maybe even unhappy at times. But it’s only momentary. It’s not overwhelming, paralyzing, or a life-controlling feeling. Even though you are sad at times, overall you still live a life full of joy.\nBefore his suffering on the cross Jesus told his disciples:\nJohn 16:22 ²²Therefore you too have grief now; but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one is going to take your joy away from you.\nThe fullness of joy that Jesus offers us is not a mere reaction to a trouble-free, easy life. He does not say you will not be challenged. No. Instead, Jesus offers us a source of strength to overcome challenges. A new way of living where we stay joyful even when not everything goes well.\nJesus offers us His Joy which does not depend on external circumstances. Joy that stays, lasts.\nFullness of joy comes from the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives. When we surrender to God and get filled with His Spirit, it becomes evident. We often call it the \u0026ldquo;fruit\u0026rdquo; of the Spirit — the results or noticeable changes in our life that come when we repent. When we turn away from OUR way of life. Go back to our Father to accept His will.\nGalatians 5:22 ²²But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,\nThe Holy Spirit lives in those who surrender to God and follow Him. The Holy Spirit lives in every child of God. You cannot see the Holy Spirit, but once you start to get filled with Him, it becomes noticeable. There is a visible fruit of His presence in your heart. We talked about peace last week — perfect peace that comes from God. It is a fruit of the Spirit. And when we think about joy, it also comes as a result of the Holy Spirit living in us.\nEXAMPLE A couple of years ago, we went on a hike with teenagers—a new route in the mountains of Adjara. It was a special one because you had to apply for permission ahead of time. But we got approval from the border police and happily set off.\nThose days, I was on a strict diet: 0 carbs, 0 sugar, period. In addition, I ate only once a day, later in the afternoon, or sometimes, secretly, every other day. It was an optional part of the diet, but I decided to do that too. It will be important later on.\nYou know, I had been relatively fit my entire life. Hiking was never a problem for me. Usually, I tended to walk last, but only to make sure no one was left behind. The only hike that challenged me was the one with super-steep trails, when I had to carry a really heavy backpack plus a kid on my shoulders. This time, we didn’t take our kids with us—no heavy backpack either. Therefore, I did not anticipate any difficulty whatsoever, or at least nothing that would be seriously challenging.\n\u0026hellip;\nI could not have been more wrong. Less than a couple hundred meters into the hike, I realized that something was not right. I was far behind everyone else—not because I was waiting for the slowest people in the group. No, it was because I simply could not walk any faster. I was the slowest person in our group.\nMy heart was racing like crazy. I was short of breath. Every single step was torture, requiring 100% effort. I thought I was going to have a heart attack or something. I had never felt that bad in my entire life. I was thinking to myself, “Is this the hill I’m willing to die on? I mean, literally.”\nCONNECTION This is how life feels without the Holy Spirit—without the fullness of joy that comes through His work in us.\nOn the surface, I was just fine. Not eating didn’t seem to be a problem for me. I didn’t feel hungry. But a little bit of pressure and difference became evident.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to be in a good place. To be a nice person, when everything goes well. When the circumstance of your life is where you want them to be. In this moment you can say I don\u0026rsquo;t help of the Holy Spirit.\nBut when we are in a bad place — maybe we’ve made a bunch of mistakes, maybe our life in general is not a walk in the park. Or maybe everything looks fine on the surface, but inside there is no joy, no purpose, no meaning. We just roll through our days because that’s what we’ve always done.\nCONCLUSION Maybe today you suffer from chronic depression, sadness, or hopelessness. You’ve lost your motivation, resilience, purpose…\nThere is an answer. You don’t have to continue living like this. There is a better way. God offers the fullness of joy to all people who are willing to believe, who are willing to surrender to Him, and get filled with the Holy Spirit.\nRomans 15:13 ¹³Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you will abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/advent-joy/","tags":null,"title":"Advent - Joy"},{"categories":null,"content":"START Greetings brothers and sisters. The Christmas season has arrived. Advent has already begun. We know that Advent is not a biblical concept. It is a tradition that came later. But I think it\u0026rsquo;s a good one.\nEven though we do not follow many traditions in Calvary Chapel, sometimes we adopt the best ones.\nIn the last few years we have done special talks during the Advent season, like many Protestant and Orthodox churches. We focus on Christmas topics such as “Peace”, “Love”, “Joy”, and “Hope”. It helps us slow down and reflect on the birth of Christ. What does Christmas really mean for us? What has changed in this world because He came?\nToday we will light our first candle, and talk about Peace.\nPeace Peace is a very good thing. There are many different definitions of peace. But in general, it means:\nPeace is a state of calm and harmony where there is no conflict, fear, or violence\nOr if we talk about inner state of a person:\nIt is when someone feels safe, and not worried or disturbed.\nWe all like to feel at peace, don’t we? It is very natural for us to long for peace.\nFor our family, peace is when we go to the sea early in the morning. We drive to our secret spot in Gonio. [ IMAGE OF PEACE ] Before you even see the water, you can already feel the salty breeze. You walk closer and lie down by the waves. They rock gently. No one is around. The sun shines on you. You feel calm and relaxed. You feel at peace.\nHow many of you would like to do that instead of going to work tomorrow?\nWe love peace. It feels good. And we don’t like the opposite of peace — fear, disturbance, and distress. We don’t want those. That’s for sure.\nStress is a silent killer. It destroys you from the inside out. Nobody enjoys it. You age faster than you should. You become prone to many diseases. Your physical and mental health suffers greatly:\nAccording to the internet:\n\u0026ldquo;High stress leads to serious physical issues like heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, weakened immunity, and digestive problems, plus mental health impacts such as anxiety, depression, irritability and so on and so forth.\u0026rdquo;\n[IMAGE OF A STREES]\nBlessing On the other hand, peace is like a magic pill. It protects you from those negative effects. It is good for both your physical and mental health. Being at peace can literally extend your life. Peace is a great blessing that comes from God.\n2 Thessalonians 3:16 ¹⁶Now may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every circumstance. The Lord be with you all!\nThe peace that comes from the Lord is something different. It is bigger and better than what this world calls peace. Only God has a real thing. The Bible talks a lot about it. We have been studying the book of Romans for the last few months, and here is what we find there:\nRomans 5:1 ¹Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,\nRomans 12:18 ¹⁸If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all people.\nRomans 14:19 ¹⁹So then we pursue the things which make for peace and the building up of one another.\nAnd these are only a few mentions. There are more.\nBut even from these few we can see God’s desire. His will is for me and you to be at peace:\nWith Him — to be reconciled and repent.\nWith ourselves — to have inner peace.\nWith one another — both in and outside the Church.\nPeace with God First, and most importantly, the most fundamental level of peace in our life is peace with God — the reconciliation made possible through Jesus Christ.\nLong ago, we broke that relationship. We chose to live by our own wisdom, to follow our own will, and to decide for ourselves what is good and what is evil. We wanted to be like God.\nGenesis 3:5 serpent says to Eve: ⁵\u0026hellip;God knows that on the day you eat from it(this tree) your eyes will be opened, and you will become like God, knowing good and evil.”\nAnd our response was: [VIDEO: I Want it all]\nWe have said, “I want it all! And I want it now!” Just like in the parable of the prodigal son, we left our Father’s house to live on our own, following our own wisdom and doing our own will. In doing so, we broke our peace with God.\nJohn A few weeks ago, on Sunday, I was walking to church. The day was wonderful. Amazing weather. No wind. The sun was shining, flooding the streets with bright light. It was not too hot, not too cold. Just perfect.\nAs I was approaching the intersection here, I ran into a guy — let’s call him John. John used to come to our church every now and then a couple of years ago. I stopped to say hi, and we started talking.\nOur conversation ended up being quite long. I knew he had been a member of a different church in Batumi for many years, but I also knew he had left that church some time ago. We talked about faith and God, and he said something like this:\n\u0026ldquo;I don’t care about eternity. All I want is to be happy right here, right now. I don’t want to do God’s will. I want to do mine. And if God’s will happens to go the same way… well… great. I don’t mind. I just want to live my life my own way.\u0026rdquo;\nStory repeats itself You see, the story repeats itself. We still fall for this. Eight thousand years of recorded history in the Bible, and we still fall for “You will become like God, knowing good and evil…” Even today, we deny peace with God to try to be the Lord of our own lives.\nTherapy And later we find ourselves at the therapist asking:\n“Is there anything I can do for anxiety and stress?”\n\u0026ldquo;Yes! Rest in God’s will. Prescribed daily.\u0026rdquo;\nGo back to the Father. Give in to His will. Put your trust in Him, and He will give you peace. This will help with your stress and anxiety.\nWhen we come back to the Father, He will not kick us out. He is waiting for us. He wants us to come back!\nWe should stop trading the peace we can have with God for the lies this world offers. We should stop wearing ourselves out with stress and anxiety, trying to figure out life on our own — always restless, always anxious.\nWe can have the peace of God, if we reconcile with Him through Jesus, the Prince of Peace.\n\u0026hellip;\nIsaiah 9:6 ⁶For a Child will be born to us, a Son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.\nIt was written about 800 years before the birth of Christ. The great promise - promise of peace.\nPrince of Peace Jesus came to reconcile us with the Father. He came to give us peace — true peace. And it begins with one essential step.\nIf you are not at peace with your Father in heaven, you cannot have true peace within yourself.\n\u0026hellip;\nIf you are not at peace with your Father in heaven, you cannot have true peace within yourself.\n\u0026hellip;\nPeople search for peace in alcohol, in drugs, in relationships, in wealth, in fame, in their careers — all kinds of things. Sometimes they find something they call peace or happiness. But there is only one source of true peace.\nJohn 14:27 ²⁷ Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you\u0026hellip;\nSource True peace can be found in a manger. The only source of peace is Jesus. Only through Him can we have true peace — a peace that does not depend on circumstances, well-being, financial stability, or anything else.\n\u0026ldquo;With faith in God and His Son, with the receiving of His Spirit and His peace, we can have an untroubled heart in a quite troubled life.\u0026rdquo; (David Guzik)\nTrue peace is not about escaping troubles or having an easy life. True peace is being untroubled in any circumstances.\nStory A few years ago, I had a minivan — a Mazda 5. [PICTURE MAZDA] I claimed that, despite its look, it was as good as any SUV. I gave the suspension a lift. It had a powerful engine, wide wheels, and big rims. To me, it felt like an SUV. I never got stuck anywhere while driving it.\nOn the other hand my friend Matt also had an SUV. [ PICTURE PRADO ] With big, fat tires, locking differential. Lowered gears. All the good stuff.\nDriving around Batumi, Tbilisi, and nearby areas on our regular routes, I didn’t feel much difference between the two — except for the appearance, of course.\nBut one day we decided to go to Khikhani fortress [ PICTURE KHIKHANI ]. Together with our families. The fortress located near Khulo. It\u0026rsquo;s in the mountain Adjara. Very close to the border with Turkey.\nWe took off from Batumi, and while we were on the asphalt, both cars performed really well. When we hit a light gravel road, I was still confident. My SUV was driving just fine.\nBut the further we went, the worse the road became — more bumps, deeper holes. Matt kept plowing through them with confidence. I, on the other hand, grew more and more worried that we might not make it.\nI had to slow down. I had to maneuver like crazy to avoid the bumps and holes, using all my driving knowledge and experience. But despite my efforts, we soon had to come to a complete stop. My homegrown SUV could not go any further. The road had become too rough.\nThat day I learned something important. No matter how much I wanted my car to be an SUV, it was not. When it faced a real test, it became obvious.\n\u0026hellip;\nJust like my DIY SUV could not keep going when the road got rough, the illusion of peace that this world offers disappears in the face of real trouble\u0026hellip;\nOnly the peace that comes from God continues, no matter the circumstances or obstacles.\nOnly God\u0026rsquo;s peace allow us to \u0026ldquo;maintain untroubled heart in a quite troubled life.\u0026rdquo;\nIsaiah 9:6 ⁶For a Child will be born to us, a Son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.\nThe true source of peace cannot be found in alcohol, drugs, or success. True peace was found in a manger. Only in Jesus Christ can we have a true sense of peace.\n2 Thessalonians 3:16 ¹⁶Now may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every circumstance. The Lord be with you all!\nThe Prince of Peace offers His peace to you tonight. If you struggle with anxiety, stress, or brokenness, the solution is to come back to the Father — to surrender to Him and rest in His will. He, as a good Father, will give you peace.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/advent-peace/","tags":null,"title":"Advent - PEACE"},{"categories":null,"content":"INTRO Last week we started with chapter 15. Brother Andrey shared with us about importance of bearing with one another. I think it is very relevant to any church, but especially for our church fellowship. Because our gatherings are a lot like those of the early Christians in Rome. Look around the room, see how many different people groups represented here tonight? We come from the different countries, different cultural and church backgrounds. Somehow each of us ends up staying in Batumi and joining Calvary Chapel Church family.\nNot Empty Handed When we join a new church in a new country we don\u0026rsquo;t come empty-handed. We carry the load of our previous experiences. Our mindset, our local culture, our church culture. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s obvious and we\u0026rsquo;re well aware of our differences. And sometimes we arn\u0026rsquo;t even aware those differences exist. They remain unknown knows.\nEXAMPLE - Paul\u0026rsquo;s Mashed Potatoes My family and I live and serve in Batumi for almost 10 years now. But before coming to Georgia, we spend over 5 years working with YWAM in Armenia.\nWe have good friends there, fellow missionaries. We served together a lot and spent a lot of evenings together as well. During one of those evenings we were cooking something after a big day full of ministries. It was regular night, nothing was special about it. But I had yet to realize that this evening would turn my whole world upside down.\n\u0026hellip;\nMy friend Paul, American guy, was making mashed potatoes. He was working on it for a few minutes and I went to the kitchen to help him out. I\u0026rsquo;m from Belarus originally and we know how to handle potatoes there, trust me. Potatoes are big part of our life in Belarus.\nI\u0026rsquo;m walking into a small kitchen in an old soviet apartment. Everything is old here. Old walls, old cabinets, old stove. No range hood, bad ventilation. Classic\u0026hellip; Kitchen is very damp and filled with steam from\u0026hellip; Wait what?\nBoiling water? Wait\u0026hellip;\nI look at Paul. He is right next to the stove with a basket of unpeeled potatoes. I watch him as he peels a potato. Then he turns. And slices it straight away, right into a boiling water. In the thinnest slices possible.\nMy whole being was screaming at this abomination! Everything he did was wrong! I could not even believe what I just saw. The very foundations of my existence trembled beneath me.\nI was ready shout \u0026ldquo;STOOOOOOOP! You doing it wrong!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026hellip;\nLESSON The mashed potatoes turned out surprisingly good — but that night, I learned something far more important. I realized I’m full of unknown knowns: the hidden beliefs, the quiet habits, the invisible lenses through which I see the world. They shape me, guide me, influence me… and yet I move through life unaware they even exist.\n\u0026hellip;\nCONNECTION When we gather together and start to get closer and open up. As we work together. These hidden beliefs and quiet habits clash. They can create tensions, misunderstandings and conflicts. Therefore we have to stay alert. We need to learn to bear with one another. We need to learn to understand, love, and accept one another.\nWHY? Why? Why do I have to do this?\nBecause this is the will of God for you.\n\u0026hellip;\nSo easy. God wants you to live and grow in love. This is the life of worship in a nutshell. This is all God wants you to do. That\u0026rsquo;s all!\nHard Part The concept is super easy. It\u0026rsquo;s so accessible that anyone can understand this. The hard part is application. Going from theory to practice. And that\u0026rsquo;s where we need help. That\u0026rsquo;s where we need one another. That\u0026rsquo;s when church fellowship comes into play.\nRomans 15:14 ¹⁴And concerning you, my brothers and sisters, I myself also am convinced that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able also to admonish one another\u0026hellip;\nAdmonish Verse 14 is the key to why it is so important to be a part of the church family. To be present, to belong, to submit to a concrete local church. Within the context of the local church, we will be able to fulfill the will of God. Through His church God will help us to become people after His own heart. He will help us to find our calling and to fulfill it.\nHe will help us to be the people we were created to be.\nReason When Paul writes his letter to the church, it\u0026rsquo;s not because they are lacking. No, he says that \u0026ldquo;..you are full of goodness and filled with all knowledge, you are able to admonish one another\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nEverything Paul has written is a reminder. Reminder to all churches what church is all about. Reminder what is following Christ is all about. Reminder and a call to action.\nRomans 15:15 ¹⁵But I have written very boldly to you on some points so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given to me from God\u0026hellip;\nIn our walk with the Lord we can get carried away. By a new shiny revelation. Or old forgotten \u0026ldquo;truth\u0026rdquo;. Maybe by our own unique experiences. You name it.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why every now and then we need to check whether we are still on the right track. We need to come back to the source. Back to the basics. And double check. Because sometimes a slight misalignment today, can cause you to completely miss your destination in a long run.\nDETOUR Few years ago one of my sisters came to visit us. We had a wonderful time together, but as all the good things, quickly it has come to the end. Time has come for her to depart. She had a flight from Kutaisi airport. Her flight was something like at 4 AM. So, we had to be at the airport by 2 AM.\nWe had to drive from Tbilisi. But, I know this road quite well. I know exactly how much time we need. But because it was a night time. We decided to go early. To make it a bit easier on me. We said goodbye to our hosts and left.\nThe drive started not too badly. We managed to leave the city relatively trouble free. Very soon we hit the highway and I relaxed. Because from there on it going to be easy.\n\u0026hellip;\nAs we drove further and further form Tbilisi. I started to notice that there is less and less cars on the road. Hm\u0026hellip; But it\u0026rsquo;s getting late so, I guess that\u0026rsquo;s expected.\n\u0026hellip;\nIn about an hour I was alone on the road. No other cars going my direction. It was nice. But a bit weird. I drove though the night from Tbilisi before. And you rarely get that lucky with the traffic.\nAnd suddenly, out of nowhere I see that the road is completely blocked. The whole road filled with trucks. Semi trailers. Hundreds if not thousands of them. And they stay completely still. No movement whatsoever. Even their lights are off.\n\u0026hellip;\nIt was at this moment when I realized I screwed up. I remember that some month ago there were roadworks on that section of the road. And they would not let any traffic after dark. Except for trucks.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been a while since they made an announcement. I\u0026rsquo;ve thought it\u0026rsquo;s all done. I didn\u0026rsquo;t even think about it.\n\u0026hellip;\nI was starting to panic a little by little. Because traffic would not move. I got blocked by more trucks behind me. There is no place to turn around. We just sit there watching the clock. My heart started to race, my palms were sweating and I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to do\u0026hellip; Frankly I can\u0026rsquo;t do anything. We just sit there helpless.\n\u0026hellip;\nThen a little movement. We drove few meters. Then few more. And few more. After a long time of stopping and going, we finally get to the point were both opposite lanes and our lanes merge. Considering all the risks we drove on the opposite side of the road, bypassing all those trucks. Until we met a police car.\nThey looked at us like \u0026ldquo;WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE! YOU HAVE TO GO BACK!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026hellip;\nWe had to drive back for about 40 minutes at top speed. Until we got to the point where we could take a detour to airport. Detour road was amazing and beautiful. Little towns. Beautiful nature. But we could not enjoy that beauty. We had to zip through at maximum allowed speed. Because, All we could think of, was whether we will make it in time for the flight.\n\u0026hellip;\nIn our Christian walk sometimes we are so confident. Confident in our faith, in our understanding of the bible. Of God\u0026rsquo;s ways. We are so confident that we start to neglect the basics. We go by feel. We start saying thing like \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m led by the spirit\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;I have a special revelation\u0026rdquo;. I know it all\u0026hellip; You don\u0026rsquo;t understand\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;\nAnd before we know it. We are far away from were we should have been.\n\u0026hellip;\nSimple reminder is what can save us.\nSave us from broken relationships. Financial disasters. Wasted time and efforts.\n\u0026hellip;\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why it is so important to belong to the church. Because in the church we are able to admonish one another.\nADMONISH Admonish means:\nTo gently warn someone\nTo correct them in a kind, caring way\nTo encourage someone to do what is right\nTo point out a problem or mistake so they can grow\nAnd unless we open up and reveal our secret struggles and quite believes. Unless we let our church family know us, our life. We\u0026rsquo;re not going be able to receive admonishment. To be reminded.\nWe also have to have humility to admit and accept correction, warning, suggestion.\nWho can admonish Admonishing typically does not come from a stranger or visitor in the church. Not every person who comes to church is able to admonish others. Because it\u0026rsquo;s not about making sure you following rules. Or instructing on how to behave.\nYou have to have character. Verse 14 says that You have to be full of goodness or kindness. Because love is at the heart of admonishing. Unless you have genuine love you not gonna be able to admonish.\nYou also should have solid understanding of the Gospel of Christ. Of God\u0026rsquo;s ways of Love. Or as verse 14 says To be filled with knowledge. If someone doesn\u0026rsquo;t have solid foundation in Christ, such person is also not going to be able to admonish others.\nAdmonishing comes out of love. Out of deep care. It comes from the desire to see you succeed in your life with Christ.\nAdmonishing is that REMINDER. Reminder which helps us to stay on the right track.\nEND If you wonder we managed to get to the airport in time. By the grace of God we left early enough to account for little adventure.\nIn our Christian walk. Lord is able to help us to go back to His path. It is not too late to turn around. To submit to His truth and to His guidance. In order not to miss your destination. In order to become a person He created you to be.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/romans-15-13-33/","tags":null,"title":"Romans 15:13-33"},{"categories":null,"content":"Love yourself in a narcissistic way Иисус и Павел, не имеют ввиду что мы должны быть влюблены в самих себя.

And today we gonna continue with this topic. If new here, we are studing the book of Romans. Currently we\u0026rsquo;re at the chapter 12. At the beginning of this chapter we are presented with the concept of a “living sacrifice” — a spiritual service of worship that is acceptable to God.\nQuestion Did you ever asked yourself a question. What does God want\u0026rsquo;s me to do? What is the will of God for my life?\nIf you never thought about it. Well\u0026hellip; you probobly should. It is an important question. Once you know the answer life start to make so much more sense. And honestly the answer is not complicated.\nWe are about to uncover the secret and sacrid truth, so I\u0026rsquo;ll need your full attaention. Let this truth soak in, and it will revolutionize your life.\nAre you ready?\nGod desires that your life be a song of love to Him.\nWhat?\nGod desires that your life be a song of love to Him.\nBut, I don\u0026rsquo;t understand. I am no singer. And what does it even mean?\nExample Yeah, I know how that feels. Many years ago, when I was very yang and naive. I was looking for a secret of singing. I wanted to sing good. Actually, I wanted to be really good. And those days predate youtube and white spread of information. So, I had to digg in into forums and dodgy websites searching for the answer \u0026ldquo;How to become a good singer\u0026rdquo;. And you would not belive how much rubbish is out there. Hours of my life and liters of tea were waisted on that endless search. But then, one day, luck was on my side.\nI found a training programm! It looks very promising. Looks legit! I hit download and start waiting.\nServeral following ours felt endless. But, now I have it. The secret tool that will unlish my voice!\nI had to wait until I was home alone. And finally, I can go into my room. It is dark hare, because computer monitor is the only source of light. House is so quite, the only noises are from computer cooler spinning. I can hear my heart pounding in my chest. My palms are sweaty, because I\u0026rsquo;m so nervouse. What if it\u0026rsquo;s yet another fake?\nFew moments of hasitation and then. I sit down and pressed the play button. Music starts to play, and after a short into the vocal coach finally starts speaking. I’m all ears for what he says. And\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Keep your throat relaxed and open, so air flows freely and your voice can resonate.\u0026rdquo;\nWHAT?\n\u0026ldquo;Raise your soft palate slightly\u0026rdquo;\nWHAAAT?!\n\u0026ldquo;Gently bring your vocal folds together without squeezing, letting them vibrate freely.\u0026rdquo;\nWHAAAAAAAT?!! Is that it?? That is what I was looking for???\nGenerally speaking yes. In a nutshell it is the recepe for a great sounding voice.\nLuckly, the program included hours and hours of vocal excersises for practice, with the examples to follow.\nBridge You know, both, our christian life and singing. Is not about knowing a \u0026ldquo;secret formula of a success\u0026rdquo;. Some sort of a hidden knowladge that avalible to only a few. No, it\u0026rsquo;s about excersising the right thing day after day. Because, you know, one thing that sets professionals apart from ammatures, is that professionals keep practicing day in and day out. They are working out, they are consistently building their voice.\nLiving a life of worship is about practicing, excersising or as it put in Philippians 2 \u0026ldquo;working out out selvation\u0026rdquo;.\nBefore we will dive into our scripture for today, I’d like to preface this by saying everything that we gonna talk about assumes that you are born again, filled with spirit, follower of christ. Because, otherwise, without the help of the Holy Spirit, it will be extremely hard if not imposibble to live the life of worship. But above all it will be prettey much pointless in regards of eternal life. Because again, selvation and forgiveness is not by what you do, but by faith and faith alone.\nWith that being said let\u0026rsquo;s start reading:\nRomans 12:9-21 ⁹Love must be free of hypocrisy. Detest what is evil; cling to what is good.¹⁰Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; give preference to one another in honor,¹¹not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord;¹²rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation, devoted to prayer,¹³contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality.\n¹⁴Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.¹⁵Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.¹⁶Be of the same mind toward one another; do not be haughty in mind, but associate with the lowly. Do not be wise in your own estimation.¹⁷Never repay evil for evil to anyone. Respect what is right in the sight of all people.¹⁸If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all people.¹⁹Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written: “VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY,” says the Lord.²⁰“BUT IF YOUR ENEMY IS HUNGRY, FEED HIM; IF HE IS THIRSTY, GIVE HIM A DRINK; FOR IN SO DOING YOU WILL HEAP BURNING COALS ON HIS HEAD.”²¹Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.\nLove first We all know all this. Some might say that it is christianity one o one. And that\u0026rsquo;s right. It is one of the fist things you learn as a christian. Basic christianity. And we don\u0026rsquo;t need basics. We are quite advanced in our walk with the Lord and therefore we need an advanced stuff. Right?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go back for about 15 years and 2000 kilometers. Back into my dark room. Where yanger version of me having my first vocal training session. And let\u0026rsquo;s learn something new together. I will teach you probobly one of the most powerful excersises for singers and speakers, anyone who uses their voice as an instrument.\nPlace your index fingers about an inch away from the corner of your mouth and gently push in and up. Relax your lips and do this BBBBB. Like a motorcycle engine. Be careful not to spit on the person in front of you though. You gotta relax your face. Otherwise it\u0026rsquo;s not gonna work. Comon, try it BBBBBB. Easy. But so powerful. 15 years later. I still do it. And not only me. Think of your favorite singer. It is almost garanteed that he does this excersise too. Every day of his life, until the end of his singing careere.\nExcersising Do you see where we are going with this?\nOur live is like a song we sing. Are you a good singer? When was the last time you practised excersises for your \u0026ldquo;spiritual voice\u0026rdquo;?\nIf don\u0026rsquo;t know any, the today is your day. Our scripture contains a few of them. Excersises that will teach you how to turn your life into a vocal melody of love for God.\nWe gonna look at 3 basic warm ups.\nExersice #1 #1 Practicing Love(Verse 9:).\nFirst exersice is a simple warm-up — we start by exercising true love. It easy, it\u0026rsquo;s safe. It is a good starting point. Remember, in singin you end where you started. If you start with poor technichue, your voice not gonna sound nice. Your singing not going to be beautiful, so solid foundation is important!\nBut what should I do?\n1 Corinthians 13:4-7 ⁴Love is patient, love is kind, it is not jealous; love does not brag, it is not arrogant.⁵It does not act disgracefully, it does not seek its own benefit; it is not provoked, does not keep an account of a wrong *suffered,*⁶it does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;⁷it keeps every confidence, it believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a good place to start. Practice this twords your kids, your wife, your friends, parats. Annoying neighbours. etc.\nBut remember is is you who should be patient, kind, not jealous. Not them.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s not all. Second part of verse 9 says Hate what is wrong. Hold tightly to what is good. That is also very important part of this worm up. Choice that we need to make daily. To guard our heart. Not to give the room to the enemy. Because, frankly if we let evel snick into our heart, then it is only a matter of time for our actions to catch up. It will rouin our spiritual voice.\nExersice #2 #2 Stretching. We need to stretch our vocal chords. To increase our vocal range.\nVerses 10–13 call us to extend our love beyond the boundaries of our family. We should learn to treat our church as one.\nEvery church is a family… a slightly dysfunctional one, but family nonetheless.\nAt least that\u0026rsquo;s what they say\u0026hellip;\nMe and you, we are called to respect one another. In a genuane way of course. Even if we are not respected back.\nWe are called to work hard for the Lord. For the sake of his kingdom. Together. Even when things do not go well.\nWe are called to be devoted to prayer. As a family, as a church. And it is so for a reason.\nThey say that:\n\u0026ldquo;Prayer is the powerhouse of the church\u0026rdquo;\nLet\u0026rsquo;s ask ourselves. How much power we produce? Can we produce enough power to light up entire city(the one on the hill), or tiny LED unit is all we capable of, you know, bright enough to see the trail your on, but invisible from a couple miters away?\nI think we can do better that this!\nVerse 13. Contributing - emphasises our care for one another. Active and practical participation in one anothers lives and needs. It means that we should be open, we inviting people to come to us for help. Showing our genuane care for one another. Second half of the verse is about practising hospitality. The word \u0026ldquo;practicing\u0026rdquo; is actually qute strong in original language. N the verse 14 the same word translated as persecute! We should activly seek, we should persue people with hospitality. Showing our love in action, not just kind words.\nWhen was the last time I practised hospitality? When was the last time I helped someone in church with their needs? Do I even know about their needs?\nPlease, be your own judge.\nWe also called to provide emotional support to one another.\nRomans 12:15 ¹⁵Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.\nWhich implies that one should be willing to share about his highs and lows. And the other should be willing to listen, to empatize. Not advice! but listen. To be ready to cry together. Or laugh together. Even if you are on the low yourself. And that\u0026rsquo;s no easy job. That\u0026rsquo;s one skill to master.\nUnfortunately we tend to start advice people instead. Or make it about ourselves. And that\u0026rsquo;s not it. Weep with those who weep. That\u0026rsquo;s all there is to it.\nSo, when did you last time cried with someone from your church? Did you ever?\nExsercise #2: Stretching our hearts and include our church.\nExcersise #3 Exercise #3 — arguably the hardest one — is learning to let go.\nDid you know that many amateur singers, myself included, often tense up? We often engage muscles that don’t actually help us sing — in fact, they resist. Muscles like our swallowing muscles, facial muscles, and the muscles in our throat.\nAnd in order to release your voice, you shoul learn to relax them. You should learn to let go.\nVerses 14, 17, 19 - all tell us about that.\nAs we learn to sing with our spiritual voice. We also tend to tense up. We have natural reactions that prevent our voices from singing freely. Our reaction to injustice.\nBecause we all crave justice — at least when it comes to our own sense of justice. When someone treats me unfairly, my whole being tenses up — and I want them to get a dose of their own medicine. And it is qute natural reaction. We used to it. But if we want to sing well, we should learn to let go.\nIn the moments like this we are called to move in the opposite spirit. We are called to bless, instead of cursing. To step back and not to take our own revange. We are called to be at peace with all people, if only possible.\nIt will truly realsea our voices. Unleashing our ability to sing the song of love to the Lord.\nDO NOT BE OVERCOME BY EVIL And for me the verse 21 is a great summary of all of this.\nRomans 12:21 ²¹Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.\nIn real life, two negatives don’t make a positive. It\u0026rsquo;s only true for matematical problems. When it comes to real life. Poor technique will ruine your voice. Only with a proper technique you can sing a beautiful song.\nConclusion Maybe today was your first vocal training session ever. Today we leared 3 basic principles:\nWarm up Streatch Let go These three must be practiced throughout our entire lives, enabling us to offer the song of love to our Lord.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/romans-12-9-21/","tags":null,"title":"Romans 12:9-21"},{"categories":null,"content":"Opposition We are continue our deep dive into a Life of worship. We continue to learn how we can glorify and honor God in every sphere of of our life.\nLast week we said that our life is like a song. And our actions, our attutude is like the melody that we sing.\nWe glorify God when we chose to rely on His wisdom and guidance rather then our own. Otherwise we glorify ourselves and this worldly system.\nLiving by the wisdom of our own can take us places we don\u0026rsquo;t want to be in. That\u0026rsquo;s why our Father gave us an insite. He provides instructions, secret code. Cheetsheet if you will. That helps us to avoide struggles. Avoid mistakes.\nSyco story I have previously mention that I grew up in a small town. It\u0026rsquo;s a nice place surrounded by forest. You cannot really tell now. But, back in the day, original idea was to build a town in such a way that if you look from above, all building would form a word. USSR. But then, soviet union fell and those plans came to an end. Leaving us only with USS but no R.\nWhen I was growing up our town still preserved a bit of that nostalgic, post soviet, slightly depressing atmosphere. Especially in the Autumn. Grey sky, grey buildings, grey roads, grey everything. In the Autemn it get\u0026rsquo;s dark pretty early. And even during the day you are not gonna see too much sun. So, even a daylight is kinda grey.\nOn the one of such day. At the evening. When sun was long gone. And darkness swollen the streets me and my friend were walking around. Talking about life. We were teenagers. I guess that\u0026rsquo;s why night time was so attractive. Half of the street lights were broken, the other half was pretty dim and very yellow. Creating this post apocalyptic vibe. Most of the people were inside, enjoin their evening, getting ready for bad. Because, our town is not like Batumi. You have to get up very early to go to work. And that\u0026rsquo;s why there are almost no people on the streets after dark.\nSo, me and my boddy going down the empty street. Talking about some teenage stuff. We can see some guys from school a bit furthur away. We know some of them well, less so some other ounces. But anyway we should go and say hello to them.\nWe came closer. Shake hands. Start chatting. And as we having a small talk I look around. It\u0026rsquo;s dark, it\u0026rsquo;s quite. I\u0026rsquo;m slightly cold. Yellow light above the building entrance about 20 miters away trying it\u0026rsquo;s best to light up the night. Not achieving very much to be honest. Some guy walking home by himself. Puffed up jacket makes him look like MMA fighter.\nI\u0026rsquo;m kinda wondering in my thought. Thinking that dim light makes him look huge. And somewhere at the back of my mind I hear one of the boys saying:\nHey, that\u0026rsquo;s Syco. Everything that fallowed have happened very quickly. Fractions of the second.\nFirst I thought to myself \u0026ldquo;Syco\u0026rdquo;? I\u0026rsquo;ve heard about syco from boys. They were telling that they teething a guy. And he gets very mad very quckly. When he gets really mad, he chases them. And they run away. It is dump thing to do, that\u0026rsquo;s what I always though. But, I imagined that they talk about harmless, maybe slightly odd, elderly man. But this guy\u0026hellip; Man\u0026hellip; This guys look like a killing machine! You would not want to mess around with him.\nAs I\u0026rsquo;m thinking that someone from our crowd shouts:\nHey Syco, we\u0026rsquo;re here!!! My heart stopped. At that very moment, the guy — a beast of a man, a total unit — turned around and charged at us without a word.\nAll the other guys broke into a run — they were ready, they knew what was coming. They’d done this many times before. But me? I froze. Blacked out for a split second.\nFirst thought to reach my mind, was the confident version of me saying: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t run. You are not with them. You did nothing wrong therefore you are safe\u0026rdquo;.\nThen reason kicked in with a counter-argument: \u0026ldquo;You think he cares? He\u0026rsquo;s not about talk — he’s about violence.\u0026rdquo;\nThat argument was strong enough. I ran. As fast as I could\u0026hellip; The guy was fast, scary fast. But hey, I didn’t need to outrun him. Just the slowest guy in our crowd.\nNo choise And you know today. We can judge yang Viktar. Maybe we can say he could do better. He shuldn\u0026rsquo;t have been there in the first place. And probobly that is true.\nBut that night I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to chose. I was pulled into a struggle against my will. It did not metter that I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be part of this. That I was there by acident. That I\u0026rsquo;m sorry. The guy would choew me up and spit me out. Before I would even say a word.\nI could not escape the situation. I had to decide what I\u0026rsquo;m going to do\u0026hellip;\nThis world Why am I telling you this story? Because so often, life is the same way. We get pulled into struggles against our will. We wish things like that would never happen to us. I know how that feels — I’ve had my own battles, and I know some of yours. They’re real. We wish things were different.\nBut, that\u0026rsquo;s not an option. We can\u0026rsquo;t control that. But we can control how do we go about it! We always have two choises.\nWe can utilize the wisdom of this wold. And worship this worldly system. Or\nWe can use God\u0026rsquo;s wisdom. And glorify Him with the choices we make. Not easy Unfortunately, it\u0026rsquo;s not all that easy. Often times you not gonna be understood. You not gonna be supported and accepted by the people of this world. If you will rely on God\u0026rsquo;s wisdom.\nHis wisdom can look foolish and counter intuitive at least. Sometimes it even feels offensive to this world! People expect you to act just like them. And they ca get upset and angry if you don\u0026rsquo;t.\nSometimes God wisdoms feels hard even to us, those who is in the church right now. We can feel upset. We can feel liek we disagree with God\u0026rsquo;s wisdom!\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t believe me. Let\u0026rsquo;s read our scripture for today than!\nRomans 13:1-14 ¹Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God.²Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.³For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval,⁴for he is God\u0026rsquo;s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God\u0026rsquo;s wrath on the wrongdoer.⁵Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God\u0026rsquo;s wrath but also for the sake of conscience.⁶For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing.⁷ Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.\n⁸ Owe no one anything, except to love each other\u0026hellip;\nWhat do you think now?\nI think that that\u0026rsquo;s a tough scripture. I\u0026rsquo;m afraid I might actually get cancelled tonight. For many of us, one of the major reasons why we are here in Batumi, is because of our governing authorities.\nAnd talking about this scripture, we will keep it close to the ground. Practical and relevant. We not gonna try to reflect on every single theoretically possible situation of every christian ever.\nBetter let\u0026rsquo;s aks ourselves what does it mean for me today? How does it impact my life here in Batumi, Georia?\nTrobulation I got pulled into a struggle as a teenage. Agains my will. I had to decide what to do in my situation.\nWe didn\u0026rsquo;t get to choice when and were we were born. Often times we didn\u0026rsquo;t even get to choice what kind of authorities we are under. Maybe the are good, maybe they are bad. Sometimes they fulfill resposibility and function God assigned them to. Sometimes they care about themselves only.\nAnd When this kind of situations rise up, it is no brainier what the world, what sosiety expects from me. - TO REBEL\nRebel Rebel became our standard reaction to express our protest. When we disagree. When we have enough of it. When we want something we don\u0026rsquo;t have, but as we think we deserve. We rebel.\nAs well look at the bible rebel is everywhere. People of Israel rebell again God all the time. In the garden of Eden, Adam and Even rebelled against God. But first to rebel was a Satan. He rebelled against God. Rebel - is his invention. It is his way of doing things.\nAlternative We don\u0026rsquo;t want to go down the path of Satan don\u0026rsquo;t we? We need an alternative. Our scripture for today suggests a different pattern. Something quite opposite to rebel - SUBJECTION. It has a few bold statements that rub us the wrong way.\n\u0026ldquo;there is no authority except from God\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;authorities are God\u0026rsquo;s servants\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nWHAT? Paul, are you out of your mind?\nAuthority is not inherantly bad. The institute of authorities itself is great tool. Designed by God. With a function and a perpose. It\u0026rsquo;s a tool that God uses.\nSo the problem is not the authority. The ultimate problem is sin. Corrupted hearts.\nPaul Paul was not biased writing this lines. He himself experienced fare amount of persecution from the authorities during his lifetime. Roman government was not a fan of Christians by any stretch of the imagination. And yet, by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit Paul still writes this lines. \u0026ldquo;be in subjection\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;pay taxes\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; Obey, Honor, Respect. Fulfill your duties and obligations as a citizent.\nThis is what God wants from you! Do this as an act of obedience to God. Act of worship.\nLaw breakers As I already mentioned God instituted authorities. They have function and responsibility before God. To serve people. To Protect them from wrongdoers. Punish the crime and etc. But even if they do not fulfill their function well. Even when THEY don\u0026rsquo;t do their part. God still want us to glorify Him, by fulfillin our part. By staying in subjection.\nWhen governing authorities does not fulfill their function well. It does not give us a license to become law breakers. God wants us to follow the laws of the country we\u0026rsquo;re in. With an asterisk.\nAsterisk Which is that we believe in superiority of Gods law. If state forces us to break the law of God, we are free to refuse to do that. In fact we should refuse to do that. We place the law of God above evey other law.\nAnd His law is LOVE.\nExodus 1:15–21 Pharaoh commanded the Hebrew midwives to kill all newborn Hebrew boys. The midwives disobeyed the king’s order because they feared God more than man. Exodus 1:17 ¹⁷But the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but let the male children live.\nAs a result God blessed them for their obedience to His law rather than Pharaoh’s decree.\nShadrach, Meshach, and Abednego Daniel Mordecai John the Baptist Peter and the Apostles It was not easy for any of them. They all had to live under ocupation by the nation. All faced this challenge how do I go about it? What do I do?.\nAnd bible is clear: as much as possible we should obey both. State law and God\u0026rsquo;s commands. But in those rare cases when they contradict one another we should follow the law of God.\nGOD BLESSES OBEDIENCE Rebel is not God\u0026rsquo;s way. Obedience is. God does not want us to suffer unnecessary persecution. God wants us to be free. Free to do His will. Free to work for His kingdom. Free to serve the lost. To take care of poor. Orphans, widows. Free to go and spread the Gospel.\nGod bless obedience. Obiedience as an act of worship!\nDoes not make wrong right Our obedience does not mean that all authorities are good. That we agree with all they do. No. It does\u0026rsquo;t justify their bad conduct. We should be in subjection not because governing authorities are great, but because we love God.\nIt is the act of worship.\nSometimes I forgive - as an act of worship. Because I love God. Sometimes I keep my mouth shut. And don\u0026rsquo;t reply to rudeness - as an act of worship. Because I love God. Same with subjection to authorities. I do that - as an act of worship. Because I love God.\nSo, today I want you to consider. How well you adhere to this scripture. Do you subject? Do you pay taxes? Do you render everything that is due?\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that we should close our eyes, numb our hearts and ignore injustice. And blindly support everything authorities deside to do. No.\nBut when that happenes, our place is not on the streets fist fighting the police. Our battle is not against flesh and blood, but against the spiritual forces of evil. Our weapon is not a steel rod and broken beer bottle, but the prayer and love.\nEven when the world around you suddenly turn full on Syco. And this beast charges at you. Like it was in my little story. God\u0026rsquo;s will for you is to avoid unnesesery persecusion.\nTo Love your enemy. To Bless your enemy.\nTo Render to everyone what is due to them.\nGod\u0026rsquo;s will for you is to Live your life as an act of worship to the Lord.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/romans-13/","tags":null,"title":"Romans 13"},{"categories":null,"content":"Romans 12:3-9 It\u0026rsquo;s been a few weeks since we looked into the book of Romans. We have had a little break while pastor Jeff and the team were here ministering to us. It was a wonderful time. They did a truly great job of serving to our church but also going out to the street and talking about God with people. So, if you were blessed by their ministy, and haven\u0026rsquo;t had chance to say thank you, I highly encourage you to send them a short(or long) text and say thank you. It\u0026rsquo;s just a right thing to do and it will be very encouraging for them.\nWith that being said now we can come back to our scripture for the week and start looking into the last portion of the book of Romans. Currently we are at the chapter 12.\nIn this chapter we start to explore more \u0026ldquo;practical\u0026rdquo; side of things. Unlike the the first half of the letter which mostly talking about foundational truth. Things which we believe in as followers of Christ. Reinforcing foundation of our faith. By reviling the grace of God and uncovering answers to some dipper life issues.\nTwo weeks ago we\u0026rsquo;ve had kind of an overview. We looked at all those things that God did for us. How great and rich his mercies are. We started to talk about the \u0026ldquo;LIFE OF WORSHIP.\u0026rdquo; that summerized in verses 1 and 2.\nRomans 12:1,2 ¹I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.² Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.\nLIFE OF WORSHIP Remember we said that to live LIFE OF WORSHIP is not dying for God, but rather living for Him every day of our life.\nIN FAMILY It is somewhat like a marriage relationships. When you enter into a marriage it\u0026rsquo;s not really about being ready to die, to take a bullet for you spause. It\u0026rsquo;s very unlickly that the opportunity would ever present itself. Way more often it\u0026rsquo;s about doing dishes, cooking dinner and putting the toilet seat down. Right?\nWhile you single, you can, and most likely do, live a pretty self centered life. Probably without even realizing it. But when you enter a true marriage relationships and especially when you start having multiple children(pet\u0026rsquo;s doesn\u0026rsquo;t counts, sorry). That\u0026rsquo;s when you learn to die for yourself. Thant\u0026rsquo;s when you learn to put interests and needs of your family above your own. That\u0026rsquo;s when the changes happen. It\u0026rsquo;s not happening automatically though. You have to make that decision and follow it through. Day after day.\nAnd unless you do that, family life not gonna work out.\nEvery single day you make decision to set aside, and at the times completely give up, on YOUR desires, YOUR dreams, YOUR needs for the sake of those you love. For your wife, your kids. And that is life of love - the life of a husband and a father.\nOUR ATTITUDE Same principle applies to our walk with the Lord. Unfortunately, if we were to compare our relationship with God to a marriage, I think it would often look something like this:\nYou fell in love and got married. With a ceremony and all that. But then, you end up never moving together. Yeah, you kinda remain faithful to your spouse. But you don\u0026rsquo;t really wanna change anyghing in your life. You meet once a week, or every other week if you are too tired. You spend together a couple of hours. And even then you only half paying attention to what\u0026rsquo;s happaning. Actually, you can\u0026rsquo;t wait to go back home to your own life\u0026hellip;to your own little things. Because this meeting became a rootin, a chore. Something that you have to do to fulfill the obligations.\nNo one would call THAT a marriage!\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t live like a single preson in a marriage. It\u0026rsquo;s not gonna work.\nAnd that is exactly what we try to do in our walk with the Lord. There is ME and MY LIFE, \u0026ldquo;MY TIME\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;MY EVERYTHING\u0026rdquo; and there is \u0026ldquo;GOD\u0026rdquo;. We saparate a little corner of your life for him and think that Lord should be happy. Because I come to church every other Sunday. Yeah, maybe sometimes I come late and go early. But I mostly there. It\u0026rsquo;s not a big deal if I check my emails and respond to a couple of messages while He trying to talk to me, I mostly listen after all\u0026hellip;\nI mean, what you think will happen if you will try that wiht your husband or wife? It will ruin your relationships. You can forget about any kind of affection. Most likely you will divorce in a no time!\nPlease, don\u0026rsquo;t try this at home!\nIf you’re living as a “two Sundays a month” Christian, why are you surprised that you struggle to experience God’s presence and His love?\nTRANSFORM When person get married he should transform the way he approaches life. Transform the way of thinking. You transition from self centered way of thinking to something quite opposite. You should go from \u0026ldquo;What can I get from my wife\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;How can I bless my wife\u0026rdquo;, from \u0026ldquo;You owe ME\u0026rdquo;, to \u0026ldquo;I owe YOU\u0026rdquo;. From \u0026ldquo;What this relationships gives ME\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;What can I give in this relationships\u0026rdquo;.\nSo, daily self-sacrifice and transformation of the way of thinking is a solid foundation for a healthy marriage realtionships that will last. Same applies for our relationships with the Lord. That\u0026rsquo;s what the verses 1 and 2 talk about.\nTRANSITION It is the same as to say that we should LOVE God with \u0026ldquo;ALL OUR HEART, AND WITH ALL OUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL OUR MIND\u0026rdquo;. We should live the LIFE OF WORSHIP.\nWith one core differance.\nHuman love can be self centered in a way. I mean we want our loved once\u0026rsquo;s spend their time with us, show their affection to us, care about us. And I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s wrong or something. And due to that, we tent to think that is exactly what God expects too. We think that true love to God is to withdraw ourselves from this world, go to a desert or monastery and stay there.\nAnd people do exactly that. They withdraw from their families. Abounded their responsibilities and obligations as spouse and parent in order to \u0026ldquo;fully devote to God\u0026rdquo;. It was especially popular in Medieval Period and it is still actual in slightly different shape and form in our day and time.\nBut this is not what God wants. Actually His desire is completely oposite. His love is not self-centered. It is selfless, self-giving. God says Show me your love by loving people around you.\nHe wants you to show your love to Him by being the best husband or wife you possible can be. He wants you to be the best parent you possible can be.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not about withdrawing yourself from the world, but changing a small world around you. Little communities you a part of. Through love. It\u0026rsquo;s starts in a family. But it is also includes the church family! The body of Christ. Your LOCAL, OFFLINE community of Christians. And then it goes above and beyond to the whole world, but that\u0026rsquo;s for the following weeks. Our scriputre for today focuses on the church.\nLocal churches face a problem in our day. We live in the world of constant consumption. And It effects us big time. More then we realize. Often we thing about the church. We think from consumers perspective. \u0026ldquo;What can I get? What would I gain by coming?\u0026rdquo;. And I must say that from consumers point of view local gathering like ours doesn\u0026rsquo;t make much sense. Because, you can go online and enjoy christian music and sing along. You can find a christian speaker who\u0026rsquo;s sermons fits your taste. As a consumer you will be more satisfied this way.\nBut it is not the biblical idea of the church. Church is not a product, it\u0026rsquo;s not another corporation that offers you a subscription plan in exchange to it\u0026rsquo;s services. Like Netflix or Amazon.\nChurch is the body of Christ. You individually is not the body of Christ. Individualistic society tell you that it\u0026rsquo;s only between you and God. There is nothing more. That church is the thing of the past. Of the old days, when bible was not available. When there were no online churches and teachers. It tells you that you don\u0026rsquo;t need church. That your \u0026ldquo;personal\u0026rdquo; faith all that matters.\nUnfortunately it\u0026rsquo;s not true. Being a part of a local Church matters. It is essential for every christian. Because, cell that is outside the body is a dead cells. You can\u0026rsquo;t be the part of the body \u0026ldquo;remotely\u0026rdquo;. At least at this stage I never heard of \u0026ldquo;online kidneys\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;remote liver\u0026rdquo;. To belong to the body, you have to be present in the body.\nChurch is not about consumption. It\u0026rsquo;s about serving one another. More often in a little, practical ways. With the gifting that we have from God.\nIf we will keep up with our marriage analogy. You can watch a family dinners online as much a you want. But it does not make you a famaly member.\nThere are quite a few people who share their everyday life with the world via socail networks. You can track their posts. You can know alot about their life. But it will never make you a part of their family. You will never have true experience. Because it\u0026rsquo;s not about the knowledge. But about going through life side by side, having each others backs. And so on and so forth.\nChurch is not about Sunday service. It\u0026rsquo;s not about hearing the sermon and singing couple songs. It\u0026rsquo;s about life as a community. Day in day out. Serving to one another. This is LIFE of WORSHIP.\nRomans 12:3-9 ³For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned.⁴For as in one body we have many members, and the members do not all have the same function,⁵so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.⁶ Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith;⁷if service, in our serving; the one who teaches, in his teaching;⁸the one who exhorts, in his exhortation; the one who contributes, in generosity; the one who leads, with zeal; the one who does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.\n⁹Let love be genuine\u0026hellip;\nGENERAL WILL OF GOD You see, Paul confirms that yes, we all different, BUT equally important. God brough us together, with our different giftings for a reason. Together we are the body of Christ. And there is a plan and a purpose for us. Everyone of you. We all called by God. He has a plan for you as an individual, but also he has a plan for us a whole.\nAnd the first thing we SHOULD learn to do. Is to use our giftings to build up one anothe. Hear me our: \u0026ldquo;God wants you, yes, you. To use your giftings. He wants you to server your family. He wants you to serve your bother and sisters in Christ.\u0026rdquo; You start there, and then God will reveal more and more specific plan for your life.\nATTITUDE MATTERS And not only we should serve to one another, but also, we should serve with a good attitude. Your attutude is as important as your service. Verse 9 says our love should be genuine or other way to translate it \u0026ldquo;Let love be without hiprocrasy\u0026rdquo;. LOVE shold be always at heart of everything we do. It\u0026rsquo;s the most important part. No matter what we do, we should do in love and out of love. Because, let\u0026rsquo;s face it. People get hurt in churches. Sometimes so much so, that they leave the church. They say that people in this world was so much nices to them then people in the church. And that\u0026rsquo;s tragedy. Because we are called to be known by our love for one another. 1 Chorinthians 13 can teach us some principles of acting in love. Jesus was love first type of person. And we should follow his example.\nDoes GOD CARE IF WE GO TO CHURCH? But often we life as if God doesn\u0026rsquo;t really care whether we are part of a local church or not as long as we pray enough prayers and read enough bible.\nI dont think so\u0026hellip; Bible doesn\u0026rsquo;t say, if you decide to join church locally\u0026hellip; No, it says as a part of a local community this is how you should live\u0026hellip;\nOur life of worship is life of action. It starts from ministering to our family, extends to our brothers and sisters in christ and continue to flow into the world that does not yet know God.\nLIFE OF WORSHIP of a one person can make a differance. By changing a small world arund you. You can make a global impact. And it doesn\u0026rsquo;t take very much. I know that you are brave people who are not afraid of a change. You left your country, your comfort thone and came here. You are the risk takers. Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t think this way about yourself. You CAN change this world. You have something to give to your family, to your brother and sisters.\nStruggles Sometimes all it takes is to share our struggles:\nBecause, statistically speaking, and what I mean is that I don\u0026rsquo;t have any specific people in mind. But based on the numbers there is more then one person right now in this room who stuggles with the use of pornography. Actually it is probobly more like 4 - 10 people. It\u0026rsquo;s a nasty harmful thing. And you can help one another to overcome this problem. If you be willing to open up and serve one another.\nSame goes for exsessive alchohol usage, dipression, loneleness, etc\u0026hellip;\nWe should live behind egocentric \u0026ldquo;ME\u0026rdquo; buble. And start to live the LIFE OF WORSHIP. You should\nRomans 12:1 \u0026hellip;present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.\nCONCLUSION Our Love for God is not something mystical. It\u0026rsquo;s not about isolation, and rejection of this world.\nGod wants us to love and serve to our families. To our church. To this world.\nAnd as we do so, He wiil transofrm our way of thinking by the renewal of our mind. Then we will learn to know God’s will for us, which is good and pleasing and perfect.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/romans-12-3-9/","tags":null,"title":"Romans 12:3-9"},{"categories":null,"content":"Intro We continue our way thought the book of Romans. Today we are up to chapter 12.\nGoing through the book we explored many fundamental truth, which is important to know. Important to understand. In order to be able to comprehend what we actually believe in as followers of Christ. And avoid false believes and false teachings. Which are presented in abundance in our day and time.\nKeep it Simple Some of the thing we talked about remain among \u0026ldquo;hot topics\u0026rdquo; among scalars for last few hundreds of years. People argue about those things in endless attempts to prove themselves right. But [show picture] we don\u0026rsquo;t do that here. In Calvary Chapel our motto is:\nSimply teach the Bible simply\u0026quot;\nWe let the word of God speak. Keeping focus on Scripture, not human opinion or motivational content. We try to illuminate complex theological jargon, and intentionally speak in the simple language that everyone can understand. Maybe with occasional spiracle intellectual “fluff” for those of us who into such things.\nWe believe that God’s Word + God’s Spirit will result in true transformation. And there is no need to be artificially flashy, dramatic, or persuasive by human effort.\nI want everyone of us to seek what we need, whether it\u0026rsquo;s motivation, comforting or inspiration. Not from a person, but from the Father who is in heaven. Even when those things come through a person we should keep in mind that the source of that living water is the Spirit of God.\nSo, let\u0026rsquo;s say a word of prayer and let\u0026rsquo;s let the Bible speak.\nRomans 12:1,2 ¹ I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.² Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.\nMercies Today we going to talk about proper response to God\u0026rsquo;s mercies. Chapters 1 through 11 explain what God did for us. His mercies include:\n· Justification from the guilt and penalty of sin.\n· Adoption in Jesus and identification with Christ.\n· We Placed under grace, not law.\n· Giving the Holy Spirit to live within.\n· Promise of help in all affliction.\n· Assurance of a standing in God’s election.\n· Confidence of coming glory.\n· Confidence of no separation from the love of God.\n· Confidence in God’s continued faithfulness.\nAll this things granted to us in Jesus Christ. And there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of good things. Way more then we ever desired. Especially considering the fact that WE are the rebels. We are the once\u0026rsquo;s to blame for state of the world. Nevertheless God is full of mercy and offers us another chance. Considering all that what is the proper response?\nJohn the baptists put\u0026rsquo;s it this way:\nMatthew 3:8 Bear fruit in keeping with repentance.\nLife of worship Short answer can be found in the verse 1 \u0026ldquo;present your bodies as a living sacrifice\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nDon\u0026rsquo;t worry if you like me and can\u0026rsquo;t immediately make sense of this phrase. There rest of the letter is a more or less explanation of this phrase. But before we will dive into specifics. There are few things to note in this verse.\nBeseech Verse 1 starts saying \u0026ldquo;I appeal to you\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; or as other translations say \u0026ldquo;I beseech you\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;I urge you\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;I beg you\u0026rdquo;. Apostle Paul begs, pleads us to urgently do something. We will talk about WHAT he begs us to do in a minute. But, first let\u0026rsquo;s pay attention to the pleading itself. Why Paul, has to beg, urge and beseech us?\nExample [Picture] Because you know, if you think about it. You typically don\u0026rsquo;t have to beg for things that just happen \u0026ldquo;automatically\u0026rdquo;. When I\u0026rsquo;m making a cup of tea for example. I put a tea bag and poor some hot water. And then tea magic just happens. I don\u0026rsquo;t have to stay there and appeal to a tea bag to release it\u0026rsquo;s goodness, that little bit of bitterness and color. And maybe a vitamin or two\u0026hellip;\nImagine me talking to a tea bag:\n\u0026ldquo;I urge you little one. For the sake of everything that good and holy, please let the infusion commence! I know you have a little more of that food coloring and road dust. After all I payed for you, I kept you in a dry place. I even pre-warmed the cup to make sure you are not cold! Please, don\u0026rsquo;t be difficult!\u0026rdquo;\nSounds funny right? It\u0026rsquo;s just a silly and maybe too dramatic example, but I believe it can helps us to see something important.\nWne we come to God. When we repent. When we understand his mercies. Our life is not \u0026ldquo;automatically\u0026rdquo; becomes the \u0026ldquo;life of worship\u0026rdquo;. It is not like making tea = \u0026ldquo;Take a sinner. Submerge him into God\u0026rsquo;s mercies. Wait 3-5 minutes. Life of worship is ready\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nOur God not going to force us to love Him, to worship Him or to server Him. He loves us and respects our choices. He wants US to make a desicion to love, to worship to follow. Otherwise Paul would not have to appeal to us. You only have to appeal if it is up to someone else to decide.\nGod is not a tyrant or dictator who just taking things He wants. Making us, against our will if it is nessesery to do things, to live a certain way.\nHere is a qote form one of my favorite fiction book, that portraise it very well:\nQuote form Guards! Guards! One of the characters reflects on his meeting with a Patrician, who is the head of the city and a sort of a tyrant:\n\u0026ldquo;You had to hand it to the Patrician, he admitted grudgingly. If you didn’t, he sent men to come and take it away.\u0026rdquo; — Terry Pratchett, Guards! Guards!\nOur Father is not like that. He not gonna force you to live for Him wether you like it or not. He waits for us with His arms wide open. He wishes from the depth of His heart that we would choose Him. But He not going to make this choice for us. The choice is yours.\nAnd that is exactly why Paul have to appleal to us. Begging to make a right choice. Choice that benefits us the most.\nTransition Let\u0026rsquo;s read the verse 1 again. I\u0026rsquo;ll read from modern translation to make it a bit easier to understand\nRomans 12:1 NLT And so, dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God because of all he has done for you. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice—the kind he will find acceptable. This is truly the way to worship him\nBody - living secrifice Paul tells us that the only resonable response to God\u0026rsquo;s goodness is to \u0026ldquo;give our body to God.\u0026rdquo; So that it becomes a living and holy sacrifice.\nAnd when we say \u0026ldquo;body\u0026rdquo; you should think, not only about \u0026ldquo;flesh and bones\u0026rdquo;, but rather about entire being. You know, our spirit, soul, flesh, and mind. It all come \u0026ldquo;packaged\u0026rdquo; in our body. When we present our body to God, soul and spirit comes with it.\nWe present our whole self — our actions, our choices, our daily life — fully to God as an act of worship, in response to His mercy.\nTo present our body as a living secrifice is not dying for God, but living for Him every day\nThis is the \u0026ldquo;life of worship\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen we live for Him every single day, then our whole life becomes an act of worship. Not only in the church. Not only among other christians or people who know us. But also when we on our own. In our thoughts and desires. In our plans and vison for life.\nExamples We can treat disrespectful people with respect as an act of worship for example. Sometimes you come across just unplesent, annoying and rude people. Our \u0026ldquo;natural\u0026rdquo; desire is to treat them the same way. Give them a dose of their own medecine so to speak. And it can be oddly satisfying for some reason. Don\u0026rsquo;t ask me how I know it. But, we also have a different choice. We can remind ourselves that God loves them. And God would really really want us to treat them well, even though they don\u0026rsquo;t desirve it. Act of true worship.\nWhen you choose not to watch inoppropriate things. Even though no one gonna know. Not because you don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy watching them. But because you know that it is not something that pleses God. That\u0026rsquo;s true worship.\nWhen in your thought, your dreams and fantasies you stay pure. Sometimes thoughts and images they come to your mind and not much you can do about it. But it\u0026rsquo;s within your power not to let them stay there. To reject them.\nAnd as we go into \u0026ldquo;mind\u0026rdquo; theritory let\u0026rsquo;s read verse 2\nRomans 12:2 ESV Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.\nRomans 12:2 NLT Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God’s will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.\nHonostly, I think it\u0026rsquo;s one of the most difficult passeges to put into practice. If we would be honest, we should admit that often reality is qute opposite. We are despret to confirm to the worldview of this wolrd and then twist the bible to make it justify our behaviour\u0026hellip;\nAnd apperently last step is not required anymore, nowerdays you can simply say that certain parts of the bible are outdated and not relevant anymore. That seciety moved on and bible should too. And that will do it.\nLoose sexual life is encoraged and promoted everywhere on media. Divorse portaied as a normal, everyday activity. There is hardly a movie nowardays without promotion of homosexual or lesbian relationships. Worldy system forces this views on us, especially on children. Why? Because ungodly system fights agains God. Satan want\u0026rsquo;s to hurt Father\u0026rsquo;s heart by causing His most beloved creations to die physicly as well as spiritually. And many christians try to stey \u0026ldquo;modern\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;up to date\u0026rdquo;. They try to show to this wold \u0026ldquo;hey, we just like you. But we go to church on Sundays\u0026rdquo;.\nNo, that\u0026rsquo;s not the way. If today you one of those people who thinks that bible is outdated and some part\u0026rsquo;s of it not relevant anymore, just as apostle Paul I beg you, by the mercy of God, to turn away from sin and turn to God. Let God to transform your mind by the new way of thinking.\nWe should let God to transofrm our way of thinking. And again, please note the word \u0026ldquo;let\u0026rdquo; in this sentance. God is not going to force the change.He waits on us. When we will surrender to Him\nThis world on the other hand will supress your will at first chance. The ungodly system Will lie, manipulate and will keep you down. Utilizing addictions and all kinds of other \u0026ldquo;assets\u0026rdquo; to make it as hard as possible for you to leave this lifestyle. Poluting our mind with all kinds of lies which most of the time lead to destruction of our body and soul. This wold is not your friend.\nBut our Father who is in heaven is not like that. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t force things on us. He let\u0026rsquo;s us choose. He wants good for us.\nSo, the main battle is in our mind. Main battle is for our will. Will we choice to present our body to God, or we will preset our body to this worldly system?\nAre we going to let God transform us with a new way of thinking or we will let this world to continue to brainwash our heads?\nTransofmation occures when we focus on God\u0026rsquo;s word. When it tryly becomes a cornerstone of our life. When we fellowship with God. It will bring transformation. As we live the life of worship. Spirit of God will work in us, enabling us to continue.\nExample When I had my first job(one of). I still lived at my parats home. Where I had a yanger sister. Two actully, but we going to focus on yanges. Most of the day I spent at the job site. I left home 07 in the mornign and would come back after midninght. I would pretty much only sleep there except for a day offs.\nAnd during this time my little sister started to attend a kindergarden. I didn\u0026rsquo;t talked to her for the first week, because I would leave while she is sleeping and come back home when she already sleeping. But on the Saturday, when I had no work. I was qute litterally shocked by how much she changed, and not in a good way. It was completely different child. She would cry, and demand and manipulate, disobey and so on and so forth.\nShe was submerged into a certain atmosphere. And she let that atmosphere influence her. And the canges came qute quckly.\nIt is on us. Which atmosphere we submerge ourselves into. Which influences we allow in our life. And unfortunately expiriance show us that it is qute easy to get addicted to this world and the things of this world. And it is much harder to reverse that damage.\nBut if we will submerge ourselves into God\u0026rsquo;s word. Into His presents and let Him influence us. The changes will come.\nWill of God To live by the will of God or to live the life of worship we need:\nKeep in mind his mercies(verse 1) As an act of inteligent worship we should decide to present our entire self to Him( verse 1) Resist conformity to the ungodly patterns of this World(Verse 2) Let God transofrm our way of thinking via focus on God\u0026rsquo;s word and fellowship with Him(Verse 2) ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/romans-12-1-2/","tags":null,"title":"Romans 12:1-2"},{"categories":null,"content":"Intro Today we gonna go over Romans 9. And with this chapter we start exploring a new theme. Few Sundays ago we discussed what is the role of THE Law in the context of the New Testament. And today we will start looking at another, pretty important question. What is the role of Israel in God\u0026rsquo;s plan in the era of the New Testament. Out today\u0026rsquo;s passage is a part of a bigger picture. Chapters 9, 10 and 11 are all talk about it. So, there is something for us to learn. With that said prepare your heart, because God will speak to you tonight. And let\u0026rsquo;s start reading:\nRomans 9:1-5 ¹ I am speaking the truth in Christ — I am not lying; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit —²that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.³For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh.⁴They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises.⁵To them belong the patriarchs, and from their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen.\nPaul prepares his audience Chapter 9 starts with Paul poring out his heart. Sharing the pain that he caries inside. Pain that he cannot cease. Because he knows there is nothing he can do about it. This section of the letter mainly addressed to the Jewish part of the congregation. But it is also very important for non Jews to hear.\nPaul loved his people. Despite that it was the Jews who most of the time caused troubles for Paul. It was them who would plought against him. It was them who resisted Him most of the time in his work of preaching the Gospel. Despite that Paul was called to be an apostle for Gentiles, He was still very passionate about his own people. Which was the reason for his pain.\nQuestion But what is Paul grieving about? It seem like the rest of the chapter contains an answer to unspoken question. When you start reading verse 6 you feel like something missing in between 5 and 6.\nIn case you have same kind of filling, let me try to help you to fill in that gap. Before we will read further, let me ask you a question. Did you ever considered how many Jews actually follow Jesus? I didn\u0026rsquo;t until this week. Until I started my preparations and got to verse 6.\nThen I realize that the question Paul answering and the reason of his grief is that most of the Jews reject the Messiah. They don\u0026rsquo;t believe the good news of Jesus Christ! They have all the advantages:\nRomans 9:4,5 ⁴They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises.⁵To them belong the patriarchs, and from their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t do a proper research, but even quick overview is quite shocking. My first findings was that only 0.4% Jews consider themselves followers of Christ. It is extremely small number. Later I searched some more and if we look globally it is a bit better. It will be more like 2.5%. But still it\u0026rsquo;s shockingly small number. And almost all this people, entire 2.5% live outside Israel.\nIt is very, very surprising, because we are not talking about some people group who never heard the Gospel. You know, some distant, hard to reach tribe in Amazon jungle. No, we talking about God\u0026rsquo;s special people. People to whom Jesus witnessed himself! People who have all those advantages listed above.\nWith this statics in mind, the question arises \u0026ldquo;WHY? Is the word or God has failed?\u0026rdquo;. Because, you know, it is the most logical explanation. Or at least that\u0026rsquo;s the first thing that comes to mind. What does the bible says?\nRomans 9:6-13 ⁶But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel,⁷and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring, but “Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.”⁸This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as offspring.⁹For this is what the promise said: “About this time next year I will return, and Sarah shall have a son.”¹⁰And not only so, but also when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac,¹¹though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad — in order that God\u0026rsquo;s purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of him who calls —¹²she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”¹³As it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”\nElection Addressing the Jewish part of the church Paul uses a lot of references to an Old Testament! Doing my preparation I could really relate to the believers of non Jews who listened to Paul\u0026rsquo;s letter. I had to go and look up this stories to get the context and so on, it is not something that is always at the top of your head. But anyway, there is few important things going on. Let\u0026rsquo;s brake some of them down.\nNot all who was born Jew is chosen by God First and the most radical claim that Paul makes is that not all who was born Jew should be considered children of God. It was very controversial statement. Because it went against traditional views. All Jews were considered God\u0026rsquo;s people \u0026ldquo;by default\u0026rdquo; traditionally.\nSame goes for us in Christian world. And Georgia is a great but not unique example of this. People consider themselves Christians, because their parents were christian, and grand parents were christian, therefore they also christian.\nOr like children of christian parents. Often we just assume that they get saved \u0026ldquo;automatically\u0026rdquo;. Just because they were born in the christian family. Of course we don\u0026rsquo;t say that out loud, but if we will be honest, that\u0026rsquo;s how we often think. But, bible never teaches that. So, in our time we have similar problem:\nNot everyone who is called a Christian is truly a follower of Christ.\n[EXAMPLES?]\nPaul uses 2 stories from old testament as an example. Story of Abraham and story of Isaac.\nAnd in both stories man would have more that one child. And God would chose only one of them for his divine purpose. Both of Ishmael and Isaac was legit sons of Abraham, but only Isaac was the child of the promise. Received by faith. And became the hair of God\u0026rsquo;s covenant of salvation.\nAnd between sons of Isaac. God chose Jacob to be hair of his covenant. And it was not because of what they did. But it was God\u0026rsquo;s sovereign choice. And his choices are not arbitrary. He have plan in mind even if we don\u0026rsquo;t understand why. His choice always the best one.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not about individuals Please, note that in both of the stories we are NOT really talking about individuals and their personal destiny. But, we are talking about nations that descended from them. And also at this point we not talking about their salvation in any capacity. We talk about God\u0026rsquo;s choices of people for the fulfillment of His plan.\nHated Verse 13 ends saying that god \u0026ldquo;hated\u0026rdquo; Esau. I wanted to mention that if you look at the life of Esau, you will see that he was a blessed man. In this context the word \u0026ldquo;hated\u0026rdquo;, not used the way we use it today. It means \u0026ldquo;loved less\u0026rdquo; or most likely it refers to the fact that Esau was not chosen to inherit God\u0026rsquo;s covenant.\nSevering choice Bible clearly show that you can not inherit \u0026ldquo;salvation\u0026rdquo;, the right to be called children of God, just by being born Jew or by being born into the Christian family for that matter.\nAlso you can\u0026rsquo;t earn it by work.\nLeaving no chance to those who believed that being a Jew == to being saved.\nSame goes for Christians. Calling yourself christian does not == to being saved. It is not something you can inherit. It is not something you can born into. It is a choice you need to make.\nAnd in our group we have quite a few children who grow up in church or in christian family. I want you guys to think about it for a moment. Do YOU ever made YOUR choice to follow Jesus? Do you every repented before Him, from the depth of your heart? I don\u0026rsquo;t need an answer, I think it\u0026rsquo;s important for you to know the answer. And if your answer is NO. May it is time to do something about it. Maybe it is time to make YOUR OWN choice?\nMaybe you didn\u0026rsquo;t grew up in the Christian home. You going to church for whatever reason, you don\u0026rsquo;t do anything that bad. But you never really repented before God. Them it\u0026rsquo;s a good time to consider to commit your life to Christ.\nAnd while you thinking about it we will move on.\nRomans 9:14-18 ¹⁴What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God\u0026rsquo;s part? By no means!¹⁵For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”¹⁶So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy.¹⁷For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”¹⁸So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills.\nInjustice Paul foresees potential reaction of his readers. \u0026ldquo;It is unfair\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;God is unfair\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;It is unfair that not all Israelites are chosen by God. Maybe it is unfair that now salvation is available for everyone who believes. After all for thousands of years they\u0026rsquo;ve been God\u0026rsquo;s special people. Following His law and so on and so forth.\u0026rdquo;\nAgain Paul goes back to Old Testament to state that it not injustice, but actually it is act of mercy. The story that Paul reminds us, is the story when Jews made a golden calf and started to worship him while Moses was on the mountain with God. And God wanted to destroy all of the Jews. They broke the covenant and by justice, they deserved destruction. But in the end God decides to forgive some of them.\nThey deserved to be destroyed. But God forgave some. Because that what pleased to Him. Not because he had too. Not because He owed them forgiveness. No. God doesn\u0026rsquo;t owe anything to anyone.\nGod is always fair with people. But he reserved the right to be merciful.\nMercy is when you get more then fair.\nMercy is not opposite of justice. Mercy goes above and beyond justice. And God have the right to be merciful to individuals as he pleased.\nApplication We should not forget that God doesn\u0026rsquo;t owe us anything. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t owe us kindness, he doesn\u0026rsquo;t owe us blessings, he doesn\u0026rsquo;t own us healing. It is by His sovereign choice he decides to have mercy on some. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget that God is not only loving Father, He is still sovereign and almighty. Do not act like as if God owes you stuff just because you follow Him. That\u0026rsquo;s how some Christians behave, but it is not the way to go.\nHardening Here comes the challenging part of today chapter. It\u0026rsquo;s easier for us to accept God\u0026rsquo;s divine and sovereign right to show mercy on whomever he wills. But not so much with hardening of hearts. When we read verse 18:\nRomans 9:18 ¹⁸So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills.\nIt just sounds wrong. Sounds unfair. It brings up uneasy questions. Does God interferes my free will? Based on this verse, some people come to conclusion that there is no such thing as a free will. It is all about God\u0026rsquo;s desire. And will of the man plays no role what so ever. We also tend to take this verse and immediately apply it to the matter of salvation. And then we come to conclusions that our logic suggests.\nIf that\u0026rsquo;s your case. I want you to step back. And at least consider another perspective.\nExamples of Old Testament If we would take a look on the examples that are in the bible. And there aren\u0026rsquo;t too many. We would see some things. Paul refers to the most well known story with a Pharaoh. When Israelites were slaves in Egypt and Pharaoh didn\u0026rsquo;t let them go. We all know the story. When God hardens the heart of Pharaoh. And then sends the plagues. Until Pharaoh let Israelites go.\nWe will leave the actual story aside. But if you imagine that Pharaoh was just a great guy, salt of the earth, top shelf, Grade-A human. Who would let Israelites go on problem. As soon as they ask. Then you making a mistake.\nHe and His Father was the reason Jews started to cry out to God in the first place. Because their life in Egypt became unbearable. Bible tell us that Pharaoh hardened his heart several times. He did his part of hardening too. It was not purely the influence of the divine. I like the way David Guzik puts it:\n\u0026ldquo;In hardening the heart of Pharaoh, God simply allowed Pharaoh’s heart to pursue its natural inclination.\u0026rdquo;\nThere is few other mentions in the Old Testament. And none of them. Including the story with Pharaoh are connected to once salvation. In every occasion it is about God \u0026ldquo;steering the sheep\u0026rdquo;, so to speak. Fulfilling His plan of delivering salvation to people. And to the best of my knowledge God influenced kings or overlords, \u0026ldquo;Man in power\u0026rdquo; in order to direct Israelites. It was never about regular people lives and decisions. Never the matter of salvation.\nNT Examples There is however mention of hardening of heart in the New Testament too. And all of them refer to the same thing. It\u0026rsquo;s not even a surprise because prophet Isaiah spoke about it well before it actually happen. And that is hardening of the hearts of Jews towards the Gospel.\nAnd if you look into it. You will see that it is divine justice. It is the result of hundreds of years of rebel against God. Ignoring Gods word. Persecuting God\u0026rsquo;s prophets. Generations of being stiffed necks. God warned Israelites about it, again and again. But they woun\u0026rsquo;t change. They did their share of hundreds hardening of their hearts for several hundreds of years. And then, same way as in the story of Pharaoh, God gave them in, or allowed their heart to pursue natural inclination.\nSo, even when we read those few mentions of hardening of the heart. It is never arbitrary. Never random. Never for no reason. And I will risk to says that except for one mention of divine punishment over the entire nation, It is not about the matter of salvation.\nGod doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop people form being saved, arbitrary. He want\u0026rsquo;s everyone to be saved and come to the knowledge of truth.\nApplication So, if Today you are in the situation when your loved ones, your close ones, people dear to your heart are not with the Lord. Or maybe they stepping away from faith. Don\u0026rsquo;t give up. Don\u0026rsquo;t think in categories like \u0026ldquo;maybe God hardens their heart or they are not divinely elected\u0026rdquo;. No. God want all people to be saved. Don\u0026rsquo;t give up. Don\u0026rsquo;t loose hope.\nRomans 9:30-33 ³⁰What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith;³¹but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law.³²Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone,³³as it is written,\n“Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense; and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.”\nConclusion The bottom line for today and the answer to the original question \u0026ldquo;Is the word of God failed?\u0026rdquo; is No.\nHebrews 4:12 ¹²For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.\nThe word of God is actually work very well. God does not stop people from receiving salvation. But His divine, sovereign choice He made salvation available to anyone who have faith. And the problem with Israel is that they did not purse it by faith, but as if it were based on works. As the verse 32 points out. So it is not the problem of the word of God. But of people\u0026rsquo;s stubbornness.\nAnd even in their case, God didn\u0026rsquo;t give up on Israel. We will talk about it following Sundays. But God keep being merciful. He not gonna give up on me and you! Even when we stubborn.\nHe is always fair to people. Not only that, but He also shows his mercy as He pleased. I don\u0026rsquo;t know about you but I\u0026rsquo;m grateful for God\u0026rsquo;s mercy. And that today I can come to Him and call Him \u0026ldquo;Father\u0026rdquo;. That I don\u0026rsquo;t have to \u0026ldquo;earn\u0026rdquo; this right. That all I need is to have faith and love Him.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/romans-9/","tags":null,"title":"Romans 8:23-39"},{"categories":null,"content":" 00:00:00 Today we are finishing chapter 8 of the book of Romans. We are pretty much right in the middle of the letter. Today we going to continue to talk about hardships and sufferings a little bit more. Last Sunday Matt gave us a good start and we are about to pick up where we left it. But before we will do that I would like to briefly go over things that we already learned so far.\nGoing through the book of Romans we are exploring some very important truth about our life as followers of Christ. We are solidifying or reinforcing the foundation so to speak. Deepening our roots in the Lord. Which is very important life long process. That insures that even in the middle of the worst storms we have something to cling to. That no matter how hard the wind blows, it will not be able to root us out.\nOverview The letter starts from teaching us that all people are guilty of sin. It is universal problem for every single one of us regardless of our nation, level of well being or social status. We also learned that justification comes by faith in Jesus Christ, and faith alone. It is not something anyone can earn by doing or not doing things. Justification is the result of God\u0026rsquo;s grace. We also learned that abundance of God\u0026rsquo;s grace is not a license to sin. We die to sin and raise for newness of life when we get baptized into Christ Jesus. But being born again is not the end. It\u0026rsquo;s not the final destination. No, it\u0026rsquo;s more of a starting point where our race begin.\nDifficulties are normal And in the chapter 7 Bible teaches us that the hardships and difficulties, troubles and confrontation is a normal part of life of a Christian. When we face difficulties, temptation or desece it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that God is not with us, that we are bad follower. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t not indicates our lack of faith or that we are not born again at all, as some people actually state. That\u0026rsquo;s not how it is and bible does not teach about it.\nGroaning We live in a broken world. We live in a world that apposes God and everyone of God. We live in our mortal bodies, which has not been \u0026ldquo;glorified\u0026rdquo; yet. They are still imperfect and susceptible to the temptations, sin and decease. Last week we talked how all creation is groaning and we ourselves groan waiting for God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom to come in full. Waiting to be glorified with Jesus. The battle is not over for us, not yet. And we do find ourselves in the mids of storm time to time. And It is ok.\nOff guard Sometimes we find ourselves strong and capable. But other times it catches us \u0026ldquo;off guard\u0026rdquo;. Life kicks us when we are already down.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know if you ever find yourself in a position when you are so crushed that you can\u0026rsquo;t even get a word out. Your completely wiped out. You can\u0026rsquo;t pray, can\u0026rsquo;t cry, can\u0026rsquo;t hope. You just sit and stair into oblivion.\nSome uber spiritual people say that it never happen if you a real one. I don\u0026rsquo;t really belive that, I will dare to say it does. Bible doesn\u0026rsquo;t say that we will never be down. What it promises though is that we will never be left alone in our difficulties.\nRomans 8:26,27 ²⁶Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.²⁷And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.\nThe good news it that Holy Spirit, that lives in us, helps us in our weakness.\nNo strength The Greek word used for weakness is \u0026ldquo;ἀσθένεια\u0026rdquo; (astheneia) - comes from \u0026ldquo;ἀ\u0026rdquo; (a = without) + \u0026ldquo;σθένος\u0026rdquo; (sthenos = strength), so it literally means \u0026ldquo;without strength\u0026rdquo;.\nSpirit of God helps us when we are without strength. God doesn\u0026rsquo;t sit on his throne watching us struggle and then crossing out our name saying \u0026ldquo;oh, well\u0026hellip; oh, well\u0026hellip; that one was not strong enough\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. No, God is loving father. God is on our side. And when we fall short. When we don\u0026rsquo;t even know what to pray for, how to pray. When we can\u0026rsquo;t even tell what would be God\u0026rsquo;s will in the situation. Then Spirit of God himself intercedes for us.\nNot bad christian If you find yourself at the point of \u0026ldquo;no strength\u0026rdquo;. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t meant that you are a bad Christian. That you didn\u0026rsquo;t read you bible enough. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that You didn\u0026rsquo;t fasted enough. That You didn\u0026rsquo;t pray enough. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t meant that God is angry with you. But you can be certain that God is there, with you. As Spirit intercedes for you, on your behalf.\nSpirit knows And unlike us, Spirit always know how to pray. Spirit knows our heart and knows the will of God for the concrete situation. As verse 27 indicates. And it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter weather our weakness has physical, emotional, spiritual or intellectual nature Spirit of God, that lives in us, still understands what we feel and what we need.\nBad things happen \u0026ldquo;Bad Things Happen To Good People\u0026rdquo; it a common phrase. And there is even a book under the same name. And more often then not bad things and decease is not the consequences of good people\u0026rsquo;s sin, lack faith, or perhaps not being a real christian at all. Usually, it\u0026rsquo;s much simpler that that. It is because we still live in the broken world and not everything that happens to us is good. But God can turn all things to work together for good, for those who love Him.\nRomans 8:28-30 ²⁸And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.²⁹For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.³⁰And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.\nNot everything that you are going through is good. Not every event in your life caused by God. Sometimes we suffer because of our own fullishness. Sometimes it is the result of someone elses fulishness. Or very possible it\u0026rsquo;s just injustes off life. Or million of other possible causes.\nExample As some of you know before coming to Georgia, me and my family worked as a missionaries in Armenia. We did some good work. And there were definetely a fruit, good fruite. Looking back I can say that it was good, fruitfull ministry. But one day it so happened that we could not return there anymore. Door was closed. Unexpectedly.\nWas it good? No.\nBut God turned it into good. Into many good things actually. Among which, we prayed and followed Him to Batumi. And we are not only are honered to be a part of God\u0026rsquo;s work in this place. But also, witness other people being blessed through that work.\nSometimes we go through finincial crisis. But God uses this opportunity to teach us to be content with what we have. Sometimes we go through relationship problem. And God uses that to teach us to love and forgive, to be patient.\nNo matter what life throughs at us, when we are with God. He can make it work in conjunction with all othere things in our life for our good, for our benefit. He can make it work according to his perpose.\nGod have a plan Because those who love God, the are actually called to His perpose. God have a plan for us. And verse 29 reviles it to us. It says that God\u0026rsquo;s perpose for us is to be like Jesus. That\u0026rsquo;s the end gaol. To be confirmed to His image.\nOur race begin from being born again. But we do not just run for the sake of running. We are advancing(or at least we should) twords the goal. And little by little God shapes us. Even in the mids of troubles, utilizing every oportunity to help us. To shape us more and more into the image of His Son.\nHe helps us in our suffering. Giving us strength to push through when we are at the point of \u0026ldquo;no strength\u0026rdquo;. Minwhile using this as the apportunity to shape us a little bit more. Confirming to the image of His son.\nSo, those who love God, are called by God.\nForeknew Verse 29 says \u0026ldquo;He foreknew\u0026rdquo;. God doesn\u0026rsquo;t need anyone to tell him, that you love him. You don\u0026rsquo;t have belong to a specific nation. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to come to a specific building, like a temple. He just knows. He \u0026ldquo;foreknew\u0026rdquo;.\nYou also cannot lie to God. You can fool a person. But you cannot outsmart Him. He know wether you really love Him or just following tradition. He is the one who searches the hearts.\nPeople can outsmart the system and pass an exam, a tests. And Get a jobs they are not quolified for. Man can trick a women to belive that they really love \u0026rsquo;em when they actually not and other way around. I saw how people outsmart themselves! But it is not going to cut it with God. There is no amount of retuals you can do, words you can say to fool God.\nIf you are in the Church today out of a sheer habbit it is not gonna pass. God knows those who love Him. He Foreknew\nPredestened Next verse 29 says that they are predestened, and this word can be misleading. We will live the arguments for the other day. In the context of the letter - it simply means that from the beginning that was the plan. And I do mean THE BEGINNING. From the very beginning God\u0026rsquo;s plan for us was to grow into or confirm, become like an image of Jesus Christ. To become his sons and daughters. To be adopted into His family.\nFrom the beginning God have a plan for us or in other words He predestened those who love him\nJustified Next point is that those who love God are justified by God. We talked about it many times now. Justification by faith, and faith alone. Apart from works, apart from national factor. Apart from anything else but the faith in Jesus Christ.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to do extra steps to be justified. You don\u0026rsquo;t need circumcision. You don\u0026rsquo;t need law keeping. It is a free gift by grace.\nGlorified And the last stop is that they are glorified by God. You are new creation in Christ Jesus.\n📖 2 Corinthians 5:17 (ESV) “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.”\nWhat ever was in the past. Will stay in the past. You were brought from death to life. We expiriance radical transformation by the power of the Spirit. It is a foreshadow a hint, firstfruite of a future glorification that is promised to us. And also it is a promise that God will not give up on us.\nRecap God knows us. For real. Not only he knows wether you love him in your heart. But, he also know YOU. Like no one else does. He aware of what\u0026rsquo;s your going through. Your emotions and struggles. He have plan for you. Perfect plan. Plan in which all things work together for your good. He chose you. And he will help every step of the way. God not gonna give up on you in the mids of trouble. He justified and glorified you, and that is only a beginning.\nRomans 8:31-36 ³¹What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?³² He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?³³Who shall bring any charge against God\u0026rsquo;s elect? It is God who justifies.³⁴ Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died — more than that, who was raised — who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us.³⁵Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?³⁶As it is written,\n“For your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.”\nClimax We come to the climax of todays passage. Point of hope and motivation.\nGod is for us God is for us - this is something we should engrave in our brain. Becouse sometimes we just can\u0026rsquo;t truly belive that. Especially at the times when we fall. When we do a wrong thing. And immidiately we look at God as if he is against us. No, GOD IS FOR US. In the mids of troubles God is for us. In the mids of decese - God is for us. In the mids of chrisis - God is for us. He is on our side! Give all things God not gonna give up on us. He not gonna live us mid way, because we are too weak, too slow, too\u0026hellip; I don\u0026rsquo;t even know what, you name it\u0026hellip;No way. There is no way he will do that! He already gave His Son for us. There is no way He will leave it at that. Example Last week I\u0026rsquo;ve been fixing our teeny tiny room in our apartment. I had to do it because paint on the walls have seen a better days. There were painting done by our kids when there were too small to understand that the wall is not the surface to try your new pan on. Fingerprints, footprints proboly headprints as well. Holes and cracks. You get the idea.\nAnd our apartment is fairly small. So I can\u0026rsquo;t just take everything our of the room and work. I had to push things around - sofa, shelves boxes and stuff. Walls had to be cleanned first, many hours and a lot of sweat went that way. Then wholes and cracks had to be patched. Then I realized that I have to remove some more shelves and stuff to get to all places that need work. Once that done. I had to mask all the surfaces I really don\u0026rsquo;t want painted with masking tape. And hit all the wall with a coat of primer.\nAll of that truly hard work is on top of all the regular activities and the ministries we have during the week, and our schedule is pretty full as is. All that to say that by the end I was extremely exosted. I became grumpy and snappy. If you know what I mean. So much so that my wife told me \u0026ldquo;Just live it as is\u0026rdquo;. Because my condition started to affect the whole family in a bad way.\nBut I thought to myself. No way. I did all this hard work. And what left is reletevly easy and actually feels the most rewording. No way I\u0026rsquo;m stopping now. All hard work is already done.\nI was not ready to give up on my work when it is merely finished. After I did the hard part.\nEven more so God not gonna give up on us:\nPhilipians 1:6 For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.\nWe have Father and the Son on our side and nothing can get inbetween us.\nIn the day of the Paul. Jews were put out of synagoge for their faith in Jeus Christ. Which was a very big deal. Not only they were considered cut out of people of Israel, but also cut out of God. No social justice. Nothing. They were considered durt that you shake off your shues.\nAs for Gentiles some Jews probobly were saying that they are have never been born again because they are not Israelites. Planting confusion, doubts and the seeds of fear in the hearts of those people.\nPlus all the persecution form the Roman authorities.\nIf you read Acts you can see kind of things Paul had to go through. But what does he say. He says:\nRomans 8:37-39 ³⁷No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.³⁸For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,³⁹nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.\nIn our harships God is with us. Jesus already holds ultimate vicotry. And there is nothing out there we should be afraid of. Because nono of those things, even though they are not just minor inconvinience, they are a real deal. They still cannot separate us form the love of God. No spiritual power, not Even death.\nIn fact it\u0026rsquo;s in the middle of the hardships often we feel the most of God\u0026rsquo;s love. The most of His presentce.\nRecap Whatever circumstances you are going through are not nesseserily indicators of your spiritual condition. Bad things happend to good people. But we should remember that God is on our side. He knows we love Him. He cares for us. He makes everything work together for our good according to his plan.\nAnd therefore there is nothing to be afraid of. There is nothing that can separate uf form God\u0026rsquo;s love. He will not give up on us, but will perfect until the day of Christ Jesus.\nOutro If today you are going through physicaly, emotinoaly or spiritualy dificulties. I want to you know that God is with you. Spirit interceeds for you even when you have \u0026ldquo;no strength\u0026rdquo;. If you want prayer come and see me after the service and we will pray together.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/romans-8-28-39/","tags":null,"title":"Romans 8:23-39"},{"categories":null,"content":" 00:00:00 Intro Last week, we went over chapter 7, which talks a lot about the Law. Reading this chapters we should remember that, letter to the Romans were written in the days of the early church. Not so long after the church was established and gatherings largely consisted from Jewish believers. Among which were Pharisees, Saducees and Regulag Jews along with Gentiles. For many of them, fallowing the law of Moses was the way of life, it was the way to follow God, the only way. For generations and generations. They knew nothing else.\nBut after Jesus died for the sins of the world. And especially when Gospel of Jesus Christ reached Gentiles new queston arose among Christians.\nWhat is the role of the Law of Moses, in the christian church?\nWhich role it plays in lives of the followers of Christ?\nPaul explains that the puprose of the law actually is to point to sin, to help us to understand what is sin.\nTermometr Law is more like a thermometer. It tells you that your temperature rises. It indicates that you are sick. But it does not provide means for curing the disease. It only lets you know that something is wrong. That you are not OK.\nLaw is not evil Bible tells us that the law is good. It is perfect and holy. Law is like a benchmark, golden standart. It is out there for us to compare against to know whether we on the right track. Law was given for the benefit of the people.\nProblem But also we read that sin utilizes the Law to work against us. Producing corrupted desires, forcing us to rebel against God. At the end of the chapter 7 we are presented with an issue. Since the law is only an indicator and not the remedy for sin, we find ourselves in a problem described in the verse 25.\nRomans 7:25(second part) ²⁵\u0026hellip;So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.\nPaul tells us that even those who genuinely, whole heartily desire to follow God law. Inevitable fail because of our corrupt nature. We talked about an issue of original sin few weeks ago. So, even when in our mind we admire God\u0026rsquo;s law, our flesh is still rebels against God.\nExample of a king David Think of kind David for example. Great man of God. Loved God with all his heart. He wrote more then half of all Psalms. Approximately 6 times more then any other known writer of the book of Psalms. All that to say that he was passionate about God. And during his reign as a king of Israel, we can see how much he respected God. David tried his best to follow God\u0026rsquo;s law. God himself calls David a \u0026ldquo;Man after His own heart\u0026rdquo;.\nActs 13:22 ²² \u0026hellip;he(God) raised up David to be their king, of whom he testified and said, ‘I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will.’\nKind David was committed and dedicated to God. And never the less he had his own fails. David was a great king. Being a great person, he\u0026rsquo;s fails was great as well. Here are some highlights.\nFailure Context Adultery with Bathsheba Had sexual relationships with someone else\u0026rsquo;s wife, while, her husband was at war fighting for David. Minwhile David himself had at least 6 wives of his own at that moment Murder of Uriah Orchestrates murder of the husband to cover up the act of adultery, because woman became pregnant Failure as a father His own son rebelled against him and started a civil war in Israel Unauthorized census Conducts census because of questionable reasons and as a result 70,000 die as a divine punishment We not gonna dive deep into this stories. Each of them have their own lessons for us. But it shows us that even the person who love God from the depth of his heart is not able to escape corruption of the original sin. You and I are not any better then David. Our nature is corrupt and law of God clearly shows that. Utilizing God\u0026rsquo;s law, sin brings condemnation and death to us.\nBible makes it clear that the Law does not provide solution to the problem. And therefore following the law does not save you. Law brings condemnation. Law requires justice and punishment.\nSolution But because God loves us so much he takes care of this indeed complex problem.\nRomans 8:1-4 ¹There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.²For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death.³For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh,⁴in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.\nJustification comes through Jesus Christ. By the grace of God there is a solution. And solution is in Jesus Christ. He came in the likeness of sinful flesh and fulfilled the will of the father, so that requirements of the law might be fulfilled in us.\nSimply said - Jesus Christ did all the hard work. He fulfilled the righteous requirement of the law. And because of him those righteous requirements might be fulfilled in us. It\u0026rsquo;s like the greatest amnesty ever.\nWho are us? But who it is for? Is it for Jews? Is it for Gentiles? Who is considered eligible?\nVerse 1 says that it is only for those who are IN CHRIST JESUS. It is for His people. Those who \u0026ldquo;got baptized into Christ Jesus\u0026rdquo;. Those who was \u0026ldquo;born again\u0026rdquo;. There are many way to say this. Our today\u0026rsquo;s scripture puts it like this:\nThose who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.\nWalk in the Spirit Romans 8:2 ²For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death.\nWe already know that we are no longer slaves to sin. Sin does not have dominion over us when we are in Christ Jesus. And we are no more called to live by the letter of the Law. But rather by the Spirit of the law. In His letter to the church in Corinth Paul writes about it this way:\n2 Corinthians 3:6-11 ⁶\u0026hellip;For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.\nIn era of the new covenant. Those who love God called to live by the law of the Spirit of life.\nWalk by the Spirit But what does it mean to live by or walk by the Spirit?\nRomans 8:5 ⁵For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.\nFirst of all we talk about transformation of our minds, of our worldview.\nMind of flesh When we say flesh, we don\u0026rsquo;t mean tissue of our body that wraps the bones and the rest. In this case we talk about sinful human nature - rebellious, self-centered, the one that tend to resist God. Setting your mind on the things of the flesh is to live by desires and thoughts produces by this nature. In his letter to the church in Galatia Paul lists some of the outcomes of setting your mind of the things of the flesh\nGalatians 5:19-21 ¹⁹Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality,²⁰idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions,²¹envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.\nIt all starts in our head, in our mind. Often that\u0026rsquo;s where the main battle happens. And our actions is mere outcomes. Depending on who we listen to. Depending on who won that battle.\nIllustration picture\nIt is not the most accurate representation, so take it with the grain of salt. True battlefield is in our mind. It\u0026rsquo;s ether sin reign in you, making you obey it\u0026rsquo;s passions or you let God changer your mind with a new way of thinking. Each option comes with it consiqences.\nRomans 8:6-8 ⁶For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.⁷For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God\u0026rsquo;s law; indeed, it cannot.⁸Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.\nThe mind that set on the flesh leads to spiritual death. I think it is also fair to say that those who\u0026rsquo;s mind is set on the flesh are dead spiritually. They cannot please God. They cannot submit to him. Simply unable. They are not IN JESUS CHRIST. They are still slaves to sin.\nRomans 8:9-14 ⁹You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him.¹⁰But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness.¹¹If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.\nYou are in the Spirit if the Spirit of God dwells in you. If you do not have the Spirit of Christ you do not belong to him. It is vitally important to have the Spirit of God. Without it none of what we are talking about makes sense. Only God\u0026rsquo;s spirit can give us strength to put to death deeds of the flesh. Only though the Spirit our mortal bodies can have life.\nGet spirit of God How do you get the spirit of God? It is definitely not something you can order on Amazon. They do not sell it on Temu ether. You can\u0026rsquo;t buy at convenience store.\nHere is 3 simple steps you can do if you in doubts:\nPut your faith in Jesus Christ. Repent and turn to God. Ask God for it. Acts 2:38 ³⁸\u0026hellip;“Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.\nLuke 11:13 ¹³If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”\nBy faith we can receive the gift of the Holy Spirit through Jesus Christ. But it is only step number one. Then we should let the spirit to lead us. We should learn to live by the Spirit or in the language of today\u0026rsquo;s chapter we should \u0026ldquo;set the mind on the Spirit\u0026rdquo;. Which will bring us life and peace.\nRomans 12-14 ¹²So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.¹³For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.¹⁴For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.\nConclusion. We should have the Spirit of God to be able to put to death the deeds of the body. To be able to overcome our sinful nature. We should have Spirit of God in order to be able to please God. This last verses indicate that there is our part in all of this. We are not called to be couch potatos(show image). Waiting on the God\u0026rsquo;s grace to do all the work.\nNot Potato We should actively participate in the process. Not relying on our own strength. Because, without the spirit of God it all in vain. But as Paul writes to the church in Corinth\n1 Corinthians 9:27(NASB95) but I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified.\nPut your faith in Jesus. Turn to God. Receive His Spirit. Don\u0026rsquo;t be a potato and set your mind on the Spirit ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/romans-8-1-14/","tags":null,"title":"Romans 6:15-23"},{"categories":null,"content":"Intro We continue our way though the book of Romans. And with that we continue our conversation about God\u0026rsquo;s grace in relation to our day to day life. Last Sunday we explored that abundance of God\u0026rsquo;s grace is not a licence to sin. The fact that God\u0026rsquo;s grace can cover any multitude of sin does not mean that we allowed to sin as much as we wish. But, rather otherwise we should consider ourselves dead to sin, in order to raise for new life for God, in Jesus. We said that you cannot be resurrected if you haven\u0026rsquo;t died yet. And our baptism symbolized our death to sin. We walk in the newness of life which described in verse 14\nRomans 6:14 ¹⁴\u0026hellip;For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.\nI feel like this important statement is one of those that often being misused to justify the lifestyle that does not align with the scriptures.\nExample You ask a couple that claim to be devoted follower of Christ:\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, why do you live together and do not get married?\u0026rdquo; And the response you get:\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s OK. We\u0026rsquo;re not under the law, but under the grace\u0026rdquo;\nWhich produces question:\nRomans 6:15 ¹⁵What then? Arr we to sin because we are not under law but under grace?\nDoes God\u0026rsquo;s grace allow for sin?\nToday we will seek the answer to this question. And as we do so we should remember that when taken out of the context scriptures can be misused to justify pretty much anything. People twist the bible to fit their view of the world instead of letting God change their way of thinking. Let\u0026rsquo;s not be this kids of people and consider the context of the scripture and let\u0026rsquo;s open our hearts for God to speak to us, encourage and even convict us as necessary. We should not be afraid to pray this kind of prayers because we know that even when God has to exercise correction it\u0026rsquo;s not to hurt us, but to give us life.\nRewind I\u0026rsquo;ve notices that my approach to bible study is very similar to painting - Every new coat should overlap previous one around 50%. And that is how you get 100% coverage without blind spots. It\u0026rsquo;s not like I\u0026rsquo;m doing it intentionally, it\u0026rsquo;s just happens. So, let\u0026rsquo;s rewind a couple verses and start at the end of our previous passage.\nRomans 6:14(NIV) For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law, but under grace.\nSin shall not be master over you Last Sunday we talked that people are slaves to sin. That our brokenness is internal and it flows from Adam into every last human being. The only way to escape from sin is to consider ourselves dead to sin. Baptism symbolizes our death to sin, just like Christ died for sin once, for all. And then we rise for new life, just as Christ were reason by the power of the Father.\nWhen we rise with Christ we rise free from the dominion of the sin. We are no longer slaves. And sin is no longer our master. We do not have to sin. Now we have a choice. In our previous life sin made us to obey it\u0026rsquo;s passions. But now we no longer can be forced to obey sin. And here is important part. We still can willingly return under control of the sin. We can give up and let sin take over.\nExample Imagine a person, let\u0026rsquo;s call him Patrick. Patrick was a good but naive yang man. And because of a few bed life decisions Patrick became a victim of the human trafficking. He end up as a worker in the foreign county. No documents, no language. Huge debts. Ridicules amount that he will never will be able to pay off. As much as Patrick hates it, there is no escape. His masters not gonna let him go. They tell what to do. They tell how to behave. They tell when to start and stop working. They control his life. At this stage Patrick lives by the mercy of his masters.\nIt is not that uncommon in our days. Human trafficking flourishing in certain parts of the world.\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s imagine that one day someone comes and buys freedom for Patrick. Get\u0026rsquo;s him out of the system. Provides all the paperwork and arranges return home. It\u0026rsquo;s amazing and beautiful moment. Tears running down the Patrick\u0026rsquo;s face. There were no hope, but now he is free. He is treated like a real person. Patrick was saved. And unlike many others he got a chance to start a new life.\nAnd here is a paradox. If Patrick not gonna be willing to move forward. To learn how to live like a free man. Remember many years he have been kept hostage and got very used to, or we can say adopted that life style. It might sound bazaar but after a while it becomes quite tempting to go back to the old masters, to go back to the life he is so used to. To lifestyle he understands. Maybe it was not that bad after all? Maybe it ok if He will let them to control him again.\nEven imagining something like that sound like a horrible tragedy. No one deserves that.\nBut this is exactly what we do when we chose to go back to the lifestyle of sin, after we tasted God\u0026rsquo;s grace. And bible says it shell not happen. Sin shell no longer be your master.\nNot under the law, but under the grace. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve had no choice. You\u0026rsquo;ve been controlled by the sin. But now the era of the law has ended. We will talk about the law in the more details in following Sundays. But in short the Law was never able to set us free from the reign of sin. For the most part it was only pointing to a problem that we have.\nBut God\u0026rsquo;s Grace did. That\u0026rsquo;s why our new life in Jesus Christ is under God\u0026rsquo;s grace. Which means we regained the ability to choice who to serve. We can choose who will be our master.\nNo Master [show an image of Dobby] Unlike Dobby, none of us have this option. If you carefully read the bible, you will know that if Lord God is not your mater, then you are slave to sin. We are free in Jesus because unlike sin, God never forces you to do things. God respects our will and never taking control over our bodies. When on the other hand sin never let\u0026rsquo;s us do what we want, but rather manipulates us to obey it\u0026rsquo;s passions.\nRomans 6:16 ¹⁶Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?\nPlease, note that Bible teaches us that there is no neutral position. You choice between obedience and sin. You ether obey God, or rebel against God. And that\u0026rsquo;s what sin is actually is. Sin - is rebel against God.\nAlso, scriptures tell us that each path has it\u0026rsquo;s own consequences.\nObedience - leads you to righteousness.\nAnd Sin or something that world portrays as \u0026ldquo;Independents\u0026rdquo; - leads to death. And it is not so much physical death that we are talking about. Because, if Jesus not gonna come back very soon, most of us will died physically. Our body will, you know, \u0026ldquo;expire\u0026rdquo;.\nThis scripture is not about the death of the body. But, rather eternal death.\nMatthew 22:13 ¹³‘\u0026hellip;cast him into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’\nAs much as we not really now how eternity with God will look like. Except that it will be much better that what we have now.\nSame goes for eternal death. We don\u0026rsquo;t really know how it\u0026rsquo;s going to look like accept that it will be something really really bad.\nLiving under the grace Romans 6:16 start to shed some lite on what is to live under the grace.\nWe can clearly see that Living under the grace does not mean freedom to do whatever you want satisfying desires of your flesh, your mortal body. Living under the grace also not about being independent and doing your thing. Like people say \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just doing me..\u0026rdquo;\nNo. This is what bible calls living in sin. Rebel against God. And you cannot obey God and rebel again God all in the same time.\nTrue approach True approach described in the following verses:\nRomans 6:17,18 ¹⁷But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed,¹⁸and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness.\nTo Live under the grace is to become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching\nTo be obedient from the heart that\u0026rsquo;s where it\u0026rsquo;s all at. Not superficial obedience. Not just formal following some rules. No. Obedience that comes from the depth of the heart.\nIt is like those people who use turn signals when they drive in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere when no one sees them. They do it not because they have to do it. Not because they are afraid to get a ticket. But because they believe it is right thing to do. From the depth of their heart.\nIt is like not throwing trash in the middle of the forest. No one gonna know. But you don\u0026rsquo;t do it because you believe that it is wrong thing to do. From the depth of your heart.\nTo be obedient from the depth of your heart will cause the change of the behavior\nRomans 6:19 ¹⁹ I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.\nWe talked about it last time. That it\u0026rsquo;s not only about stopping doing the wrong things, but it\u0026rsquo;s about start doing the right thing. Sin often uses our members that have been given to us by God for good works, to do lawlessness which leads to eternal death.\nBut once you\u0026rsquo;ve been raised for a new life you need to present very same members of your body, which sin used for lawlessness, for doing righteousness. And this will lead to sanctification. Which will lead to eternal life in Christ Jesus.\nRomans 6:20-22 ²⁰ For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.²¹ But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.²²But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life.\nThe bottom line is that living under the Grace is to be obedient from the heart to God and His Word. You cannot continue in sin. Do not fool yourselves you cannot live a life of obedience to God and rebel against God all in the same time. You have to chose one or the other. But remember:\nRomans 6:23 ²³ For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\nThe choice is ours. If you never have been born again today is the day. To die for sin, and raise for new life for God in Jesus Christ. Or maybe you are going to church for a while now. But in all honesty you can\u0026rsquo;t say that you are obedient from the depth of your heart. Maybe not too much righteousness happening in your life. Maybe you slipped to the old way of living.\nIf that\u0026rsquo;s something that resonate with you. I invite you to pray.\n00:00:00 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/romans-6-15-23/","tags":null,"title":"Romans 6:15-23"},{"categories":null,"content":"START We continue our study of the book of Romans. We are up to chapter 6. We will cover the first half of the chapter today. Let\u0026rsquo;s start form gathering a little bit of context. It is always helpful but especially useful if you new to the book and did not go over all previous chapters with us.\nContext Last Sunday we talked about the issue of original sin. The scriptures tells us that we all affected by this phenomena. Corruption that flows from Adam, our forefather, down to every single human being. \u0026ldquo;Contamination at the source\u0026rdquo; as it was stated. It effects all people, regardless of the nation or any other factor. We discovered that in a contrary to a common conception that all people are born pure, and the corruption is the fault of their surrounding. Biblical perspective is that there can be no environment that is so perfect , that one can live a holy life. Simply because our contamination is not external but internal. Broken state of the people is not just a result of an external factors. External circumstances definitely can work as a multiplier. But if we would look at the root of the issue, truth is that we are fundamentally broken inside. Our nature is contaminated by the sin.\nGod\u0026rsquo;s holiness And that is the problem because God is not compatible with sin. He is perfectly holy and nothing sinful can withstand his presents. You can think about God\u0026rsquo;s holiness as a fire. Imagine yourselves in the forest at the night time. It\u0026rsquo;s dark, it\u0026rsquo;s cold. It\u0026rsquo;s scary. All that was so familiar just a moment ago can no longer be recognized. You are lost and afraid. But, you can see a bonfire in between trees. You see the light. It gives you hope. It\u0026rsquo;s not so scare anymore. You start to walk towards the light. As you get closer, you start to feel the warmth. You hear the crackle of the fire as it burns, it is so comforting. You sit next the flame and the night is not so scary anymore.\nBut what would happen if you will get to close? If you will stick your heads or feet right into the fire? They will burn. Pain. Distruction. We all know the feeling.\nThat is why prophet Isaiah was so scared when he found himself in the presents of God.\nIsaiah 6:5(NLT) Then I said, “It’s all over! I am doomed, for I am a sinful man. I have filthy lips, and I live among a people with filthy lips. Yet I have seen the King, the LORD of Heaven’s Armies.”\nAnything that unclean will perish in the presents of God. That is why we need to be purified in order to be with God.\nJustification is free through faith Last week we talked about water. And as the water has to go through the filtration in order to return to it\u0026rsquo;s original, pure state. We are getting purified by faith in Jesus Christ. We explored that justification is not something that we can earn by doing(or not doing) things. It is something that comes as a free gift, by the grace of God, though faith. Justification guaranteed to everyone who believe. This is a promise that backed by God and it is available for everyone. It only requires faith, the rest is covered by the grace of God. Uniqueness of God\u0026rsquo;s grace is that it\u0026rsquo;s always enough. There is no sin that is so great that God\u0026rsquo;s grace would not be able to cover.\nAnd again idea that justification comes by faith and not by works was revolutionary back in the day. And I think that even today many people do not fully understand what that means. A lot of people live in the world were justification, or forgiveness comes by following tradition, following rules. By doing the right thing. Back in the day it was circumcision and following \u0026ldquo;The Law\u0026rdquo;. And when we say that justification comes apart from work, that it is the gift of God that comes by grace.Our human logic derives conclusion. The view that gained popularity recently. But which in fact nothing new. Back in the day of Paul, people already was tricked by this lie.\nHyper Grace \u0026ldquo;New\u0026rdquo; teaching that flooded the minds of people all over the world is called \u0026ldquo;Hyper Grace teaching\u0026rdquo;. Which is effectively focuses ONLY on God\u0026rsquo;s grace and disregard everything else. Some key point of this belief would be\nOnce saved, a believer is permanently righteous in God\u0026rsquo;s eyes, regardless of behavior. There is no need to ask for forgiveness repeatedly, because all sins are already forgiven. Jesus’ earthly teachings (pre-cross) were still under the Old Covenant. Therefore, much of what Jesus said (e.g., Sermon on the Mount) was aimed at Jews under the Law, not directly at Christians today. Those are just a few highlights and not a comprehensive list of key differences. By the rough estimate tens of millions of Christians today following this false teachings. There is a good chance that there is more than one person right in this room who follow this teachings maybe without even knowing that. Teaching that criticized by pretty much every major christian confession along with the bible itself.\nCondensed doctrine If we would condense the doctrine of the hyper grace into a one question, we would effectively get the verse 1 of the chapter 6:\nRomans 6:1 ¹What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?\nIn other words if justification requires no works. And grace is always enough, maybe then I can continue to live the way I lived before I came to Christ Jesus? All my sins are covered by the work of the cross, so who cares if I continue to sin\u0026hellip;\nRomans 6:2 ²By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it?\nYou see that Short answer is \u0026ldquo;No, you cannot continue in sin.\u0026rdquo;\nAbundance of God\u0026rsquo;s grace by no means is a licence to sin.\nRomans 6:3 ³Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?⁴We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.\nBaptism Paul begins to explain why it is not OK. All the readers of the Paul\u0026rsquo;s letter were baptized(Greek word that means to immersed, to be covered over with) via water baptism. It was, and still is a very important Christian practise and the command of Jesus. The idea that baptism is something optional, something that is not important is not a biblical idea. Everyone who believed in Jesus were getting baptized by His church. So, if you consider yourself a follower of Christ, but you never been baptized I strongly recommend to do so. The baptism in our today\u0026rsquo;s scriptures portrays a very important spiritual reality. That there has to be a dramatic change in life of the believer at the moment of repentance. Our old self, old corrupted spiritual nature die and being buried with Christ, and then we rise with Christ for the new life by the power of the Father.\nIt worth mentioning that baptism illustrates that spiritual reality but it does not make that reality come to pass.\nThis reality comes to pass when we come to God with genuine repentance. When we confess our sins and ask Him for forgiveness. When we genuinely desire to change. We die to our old life, old ways, old self. And rise with Christ for new life in him.\nWe are called to walk in the newness of life. And not to continue to live in sin. And we do it not by our own strength but by the power of the Father.\nRomans 6:5-11 ⁵For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.⁶We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.⁷For one who has died has been set free from sin.⁸Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.⁹We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.¹⁰For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God.¹¹So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t rise if you haven\u0026rsquo;t died You cannot be resurrected if you haven\u0026rsquo;t died yet. If never actually said good buy to your old, sinful life and your \u0026ldquo;old self\u0026rdquo; is still reign in you. Then sin will also reign in you along with it. We cannot continue to live our old life of rebel against God and expect to be, accepted, reconciled and united with Him.\nThe way to get freedom The only way to get free from sin is though death. Our old self should be crucified with Jesus. And it is something that is happening during our repentance. It\u0026rsquo;s not something that we should do, but something that is done by the power of God. We don\u0026rsquo;t have to battle our \u0026ldquo;old man\u0026rdquo;, but simply regard him as dead. Just as a verse 6 says. When we die with Christ in this way death and sin have no dominion over us anymore. We are free to live a new life, we inherit the eternal life.\nBut the new life is not so that we can live for ourselves. Just as Christ lives his life for God we also should consider ourselves dead to sin and live to God.\nRomans 6:12-14 ¹²Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions.¹³ Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness.¹⁴For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.\nHG vs Bible Even though our \u0026ldquo;old self\u0026rdquo; was crucified and we are no longer slaves to sin. Our mortal bodies are still susceptible to the temptations. Sin cannot take over you against your will. But you can willingly give up the control to sin. Unlike the promoters of Hyper Grace who say that there is nothing we should do, nothing to worry about. That everything we just happen \u0026ldquo;by itself\u0026rdquo; as long as we focus on who we are in Christ. Apostle Paul clearly states that there is our part in all this. It is within our power and it is our responsibility not to let sin reign in our mortal bodies. Sin wants to make you to obey its passions. Sin want to have control over you. As a slave owner do not want to let his slaves go free, even though they are free legally speaking.\nThere is two part to this process. And first thing that we do is written in the verse 13:\nRomans 6:13 ¹³ Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness.\nIf we would read literal translation it would say \u0026ldquo;do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin\u0026rdquo;.\nMembers What are those members that Paul is writing about? It is our eyes, our ears, hands and feet and the rest. How can we preset the members of our body to sin? This days in Batumi it is not that hard. Once summer season is started the city full of people, man and women who decided that wearing as little cloth as possible is the way to go. And just by walking on the street you can\u0026rsquo;t help but see things. Then it is up to you, to look away and not let sin use your eyes as instrument of unrighteousness. Or to let yourself, you know, enjoy the view so to speak.\nWhen someone cut\u0026rsquo;s you off while you drive. It is up to you whether you will let your mouth to be used as an instrument of unrighteousness.\nWhen you browsing the internet youtube, instagram, facebook etc. What do you do with the inappropriate things you see? Maybe you visit websites no Christian should visit?\nIt can be all sorts of things. You know your areas of weakness.\nFirst step Once Christ set us free, and we regained control over our life first thing we should do is to stop doing the wrong thing. We used to be slaves to sin. We used to be controlled by it without even realizing it. But when we come to Christ, we die to sin. We are no longer slaves. It is NOT OK for me to keep doing the wrong things waiting on God to change me. It is not the way bible teaches.\nBible says that we should stop willingly present ourselves to sin. Sin cannot force us. But we can give up control and let sin reign. Like a freed slaves who return to their old master.\nStop old Do not go to the bar or club. Because you know that you WILL present your body to sin if you do. If things on the internet trip you up, stop visiting those websites. Install blockers, set up your devices. There is people who can help you with that if you want. Do not preset your eyes, your ears and the rest of your body to sin. It can be hard at the beginning, because we used to do those things. It can be hard to break the old habits. Sometimes you find yourself starting to do things automatically, almost subconchansly and only half way through you think \u0026ldquo;what actually I am doing?\u0026rdquo;.\nRemember, you died to sin. You no longer slave. You can break out. There some things, addictions that are harder to stop, but with God everything is possible.\nStart new habits But it\u0026rsquo;s not only about stopping, but rather reversing. The second part of the process is to present yourself to God. Let God use you for righteousness. For his good purposes. And often when it comes to serving God, we start looking for the most perfect calling for our lives. And we not willing to do anything unless we absolutely exited about the thing. Unless we feel that we\u0026rsquo;ve been created with the sole purpose to do this very ministry. But I challenge you to look at serving God from different perspective. From the perspective of unemployed who desperately need money. When you in the super tight spot, you ready to do any work. To be a weightier, to do the dished, to distribute brochures, whatever is available. Typically you are not rejecting opportunities when your kids are hungry and you have nothing to pay your bills with.\nBe ready to do anything. At least for a time. Be ready to preset members of your body to God as instruments for righteousness.\nIf your hands use to destroy and cause pain. Let God use them to build up and healing. If you tongue use to curse, let God use it to bless.\nStop putting yourself into places where you know you gonna sin. Instead bring yourself to a bible study for example. I cannot promise that it will be super entertaining for you. Even though personally I enjoy our bible studies. But what I can promise is that you not gonna be exposed to sin during this time. There will be no alcohol, no pornography, no filthy talks. You\u0026rsquo;ll find people who will help you to stay away from sin.\nConclusion: Today we learned that even though God\u0026rsquo;s grace has no limit. It is so great that it covers any multitude of sins. Even though justification is a gift of God. Even though God takes care of our old nature, we cannot continue to live in sin. We are dead to sin, it is the truth of the Bible and we should live accordingly. We were resurrected with Christ to live for God.\n00:00:00 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/romans-6-1-14/","tags":null,"title":"Romans 6:1-14"},{"categories":null,"content":"We are continue to talk about \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; view of justification by God. And today we will look at Abraham.\nWhy Abraham Why Abraham? Well, I think it is fare to say that with Abraham begins the story of \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rsquo;s special people\u0026rdquo;. The story of salvation and Abraham is one of the key figures. He is the forefather of Jewish nation. And not only that, but he also considered a forefather of all who believes God.\nWe can find the story of Abraham right in the beginning of the bible in the book of Genesis chapter 12. It\u0026rsquo;s basically at the very start. Rough historic timeline would look like this:\nNoah came out of the Arc and God promised to never flood the earth again. Approximately 100-200 years later there were story of the Babilon\u0026rsquo;s tower where people revolted against God once again. And then around 300 years after the flood Abraham was born. Fun Fact Little fun fact is that Noah were still alive when Abraham was born. Noah died when Abraham was in his fifties.\nDid Abraham and Noah hang out? I don\u0026rsquo;t know they were 10 generations apart. And they lived quite far away from one another. But everything is possible.\nOne requirement Anyway, God speaks to Abraham in chapter 12. Promising some really amazing things. With effectively ONE foundational requirement of faith expressed through obedience.\nAbraham hears God and makes the step of faith. He belied God and it changed the course of His own life and the course of the history forever. Abraham was 75 years old at that point. His faith was put to the test big time more then once. He had to believe agains the odds and against logic. He had to believe beyond possible. And he passed those tests every time. He was not a perfect person by any means, He had his share of mistakes that he made along the way. But never the less he is an amazing example of faith and faithfulness to God.\nISSUE He became a key figure and quite literally forefather of all God\u0026rsquo;s people. So much so that a lot of Jews believed that they will be justified because they are descendants of Abraham. For example when people have come to John the baptist to get baptized into forgiveness of sins John warned them:\nLuke 3:8 ⁸Bear fruits in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.\nWhy does he say that? He says that because one of the main teachings and quite common believe among Jewish people was that justification comes through GENEALOGICAL BELONGING:\n\u0026ldquo;We are justified because of our forefather Abraham, because we are his descendants\u0026rdquo;.\nIn fact it was even more radical(at least radical from our point of view). That God ONLY concerned with Abraham and his descendants. That he is God of Jews only. That\u0026rsquo;s how people believed and how word of God was interpreted for hundreds of years.\nContrary view But at the end of the Chapter 3 we read this verses:\nRomans 3:29,30 ²⁹\u0026hellip;is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,³⁰since God is one — who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.\nWe know that God is ONE and there is NO other Gods. Paul brings us to conclusion that God does not belong to ANY specific group of people AND He is NOT LIMITED by any specific people group. He is God of ALL people. He love all people all the same, he judges all people all the same and justifies all people all the same. All though faith.\nThe Scripture And to confirm whether it\u0026rsquo;s true, we will look at the forefather of faith. How did it worked it his case. How did he get justified\nRomans 4:1-8 ¹What then shall we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh? ²For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. ³For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.” ⁴Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due. ⁵And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness, ⁶just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:\n⁷ “Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; ⁸blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin.”\nWe start off by reading that in hypothetical case in which Abraham was justified because of what he did, he would have a reason to boast. He would be able to take pride in his achievement. Like a cage fighter, when he wins the title, he rejoices, he holds that belt above his head running in circles, for everyone to see. Because he did it! He won. He worked hard and now it is his moment of glory.\nHowever bible says that Abraham had NOTHING to boast about before God. Because the real reason for his justification is in the verse 3:\nRomans 4:3 ³\u0026hellip;“Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.”\nYou see, it\u0026rsquo;s not the hard work. Not the birth. Not anything else but his faith that brought the justification. It is not wages. Not something that you can earn by working hard. It is a gift. It is a blessing. Blessing of forgiveness and justification as the verse 7 says.\nYou cannot earn Gods forgiveness or justification. It is simply impossible. But that\u0026rsquo;s not even the main point, the greater reason is that God desires to make it available to ANYONE at ALL TIMES. And this is why You can ONLY receive it as a gift, as a blessing. No one ever EARNED justification. Not even Abraham. Faith that expressed though obedience - that were it\u0026rsquo;s at.\nNext question And so, if Abraham got justified because of faith, is this option available only for him or is this for everyone? Let\u0026rsquo;s find out:\nRomans 4:9-12 ⁹Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness.¹⁰How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised.¹¹ He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well,¹²and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think any of this comes by a surprise. Recently we spent the entire Sunday reflecting on God\u0026rsquo;s justice. We know that God is just and treats people fairly. We can see that this blessing and promise are not only for those who are Abraham\u0026rsquo;s descendants by birth. This blessings are available to me and you. As long as we are Abraham\u0026rsquo;s children by heart. As long as we have the same faith in God. Those are true descendants, who walk in the footsteps of the faith of Abraham.\nRomans 4:13-15 ¹³For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith.¹⁴ For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void.¹⁵For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression.\nYou see if only those who will fulfill the law would be heir of the world then it is an empty promise. Then faith not even required. You do not need to have faith, because in this case it is due to you.\nIt is an empty promise because the only thing you can get by relaying on the law is wrath. No human ever successfully fulfilled God\u0026rsquo;s law. No human ever will fulfill the law. It is sort of like an old joke that there is a Nobel\u0026rsquo;s prize to the first man who will successfully give a birth. It is never going to happen it is biologically impossible.\nSame with people and God\u0026rsquo;s law. Humans are not capable to adhere to God\u0026rsquo;s standard of righteousness. The bar is too high for us in our broken condition. There is only one way around this issue. And this is not to go that route. Do not rely on your works, they not gonna justify you before God.\nRomans 4:16-25 ¹⁶That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring — not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,¹⁷as it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations” — in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist.¹⁸In hope he believed against hope, that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been told, “So shall your offspring be.”¹⁹He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah\u0026rsquo;s womb.²⁰No unbelief made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God,²¹fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.²²That is why his faith was “counted to him as righteousness.”²³But the words “it was counted to him” were not written for his sake alone,²⁴but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord,²⁵ who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.\nGod, by His great mercy, made those blessings a promise that rest on grace. This way it is guaranteed to ALL of us. There is no limiting factors. It does not depends on outwardly circumstances. You cannot earn what\u0026rsquo;s been promised. You can only receive it by grace via faith.\nFAITH THAT EXPRESSED THOUGH OBEDIENCE.\nToday we can be considered descendants of Abraham, his offspring. We all are fulfillment of God\u0026rsquo;s promise to him. And as his offspring we share the promises that God made to Abraham. As long as we walk in the footsteps of faith.\nAbraham was the person who believed God against the odds. They were not on his side. The facts of life were against him. But he believed never the less. He grew strong in faith as he gave glory to God. He believed that God can do the impossible. He believed AND acted upon it. Because Abraham was the man of faith expressed through obedience.\nSo, what do we learned today:\nWe learned that no one get\u0026rsquo;s justified because of what he does. Not even Abraham, forefather of all who follow God.\nWe learned that justification and forgiveness are the blessings that are promised and guaranteed by Gods grace. And they can ONLY be received by faith.\nAbraham believed the words of God. He believe into the promises God made to him. And this faith were counted as righteousness.\nJust as God made promise to Abraham. God also made a promise to us. Promise that requires faith, living, active faith. The promise we should believe in order to be justified. And it is a good news of Jesus. We need to have Faith in Jesus Christ that will be expressed in obedience to him. Which gives us more then justification. It makes us the children of God.\nBut without this faith, all you can hope for is wrath and fury.\nPeople come and ask \u0026ldquo;what is the practicality of it all?\u0026rdquo;. And it\u0026rsquo;s a fair question.\nFirst and foremost you can have confidence. That there is no pitfalls when it comes to God. He is fair as no one else.Yes, God is perfectly fair, but also He is perfectly good and perfectly kind and perfectly loving. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget that. He is FOR you, not against you.\nThere other one is that. You are not required to do something special in order to get God\u0026rsquo;s promise. You do not have to become Jew of follow Mosaic or any other law. No rituals, no nothing. If you still trying to earn justification by doing things, please stop. It is a gift, that you receive though faith. Not knowledge, not any kind of faith. But faith which expressed through obedience.\n00:00:00 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/romans-4/","tags":null,"title":"Romans 4"},{"categories":null,"content":"As always we will start from a little recap from previous weeks. In case you haven\u0026rsquo;t been here last time, we are going through the Book or Romans and we are up to a chapter 3. Last few Sundays we spent talking about the state of the world. The state of the church and the problem that exited at the time, which by the way even though changed it\u0026rsquo;s form, still remains relevant. Problem that Holy Spirit addresses through apostle Paul, fulfilling God\u0026rsquo;s plan. Slowly but surely we advance towards new way of thinking, towards a new perspective on following the Lord. Drifting away from justification by works, and shifting our attention to justification by faith. And ultimately are we going through the battle of religion vs living faith.\nLast Sunday we discussed that being right with God does not come because of the national factor. It Does not come by the shire belonging to a specific group of people.\nRomans 2:28,29 ²⁸For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical.²⁹But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God.\nWe talked that being religious does not help people. It did not help Jews to be right with God. And not gonna help us as well. So, religiosity is not what we are after. Loving God is not about following some rules, it\u0026rsquo;s not about having high moral standards or practicing certain activities. It is all outward and visual but not necessarily reflect inner state of man. If you think that going to church makes you right with God, it is not. It you think that to live for God it is to follow the set of rules, it is not. God pleased with people who are circumcised at their heart, in the Spirit. As it emphasized in the 2nd chapter.\nSame as being a Jew, having a physical circumcision, practicing the law. Not gonna justify you before God.\nIt was very contrary view for the people of the day. And it produced a question among the Jewish(and not only Jewish) follower of Christ, question which we will address today:\nRomans 3:1 ¹Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision?\nIf belonging to God\u0026rsquo;s nation does not \u0026ldquo;buy\u0026rdquo; you pass to God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom. If it\u0026rsquo;s not a basis for justification. What\u0026rsquo;s a point then? Then what\u0026rsquo;s the difference between God\u0026rsquo;s people and the rest of the world? Why would you bother to live a life devoted to God. It does not make any sense. For hundreds of years people believed that this is how you get justified before God. By being one of His special people. By following the law. And if that is not true. If God will judge all people the same way, what advantage have His \u0026ldquo;special\u0026rdquo; people?\nRomans 3:2-4 ²Much in every way. To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.³ What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God?⁴By no means! Let God be true though every one were a liar, as it is written,\n“That you may be justified in your words, and prevail when you are judged.”\nThe people of Israel do have an advantage. But, it is not what they thought. The advantage is not that God will treat their sin any different. It is not that God will evaluate their life according to some different standards. No, we already figured that God shows no partiality. He does not respect the outward circumstances of the man.\nVerse 2 in ESV translation says \u0026ldquo;to begin with\u0026rdquo;. Which in my opinion is not the best way to put it. At least it does not sit right with me. Because, for me it assumes there will be some kind of list of things and Paul does not present a list things. At least not right here. But rather emphasize importance of one of them. I think the better way to put it would be like in KJV \u0026ldquo;Chiefly\u0026rdquo; or like NIV says \u0026ldquo;First of all\u0026rdquo;.\nThe most important advantage is that God trusted Jewish people with his word. It is to them God decided to revile Himself. Though them we have written word of God today. To them God reveled His will, His plans, and His ways. They have received God\u0026rsquo;s promises, His blessings. To them God sent His son. God decided to bless entire humanity via them. If that\u0026rsquo;s not an advantage I don\u0026rsquo;t know what is.\nRomans 3:3 ³ What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God?\nUnfortunately big portion of God\u0026rsquo;s special people rejected God\u0026rsquo;s blessing. They did not believe in Jesus, the Son of God. The messiah, the savior of the world. And it might seems like now God\u0026rsquo;s plans failed, nullified. His very special people have blown it. And now the rest of the world not gonna get those sweet blessings of God because those guys messed it up!\nPraise God, it is not the case. Let\u0026rsquo;s look into next verse. I will use a modern translation for sake of ease of understanding:\nRomans 3:4 (NLT) Of course not! Even if everyone else is a liar, God is true. As the Scriptures say about him,\n“You will be proved right in what you say, and you will win your case in court.”\nLuckily for us, there is nothing that can stop God\u0026rsquo;s plans. They will come into existence regardless. Because God is always true to His word. And the basis of His promises is Himself, and that is why we CAN and SHOULD rely on God more the anything else. God and His world are truly immutable. They never change. Even if every last man will turn away from God, he will still be true to the promises He made to people. So, faithlessness of God\u0026rsquo;s special people do not nullify His plans, but rather reveal the greatness of God. Because, He stays true even though people are not.\nRomans 3:5 (NLT) 5“But,” some might say, “our sinfulness serves a good purpose, for it helps people see how righteous God is. Isn’t it unfair, then, for him to punish us?” (This is merely a human point of view.)\nThis section(few following verses) might sound a bit confusing at first. To underhand what it\u0026rsquo;s all about a bit better, we need to take into account a few things. Back in a Paul\u0026rsquo;s day it was common in philosophical and legal debates to pose a slippery-slope “what if” scenario — showing that a single premise, taken to its logical extreme, produces an absurd or unjust result.\nWhat Paul is saying, and we talk about this for the last few Sundays, is that we cannot be justified by the work of the law. That the law only points to God\u0026rsquo;s justice, to His goodness. How exactly law points to God\u0026rsquo;s goodness? Because God forgives a sinner(Jew and Gentile), if that sinner repents, apart from his the works. And judges those who do not repent by their works. And it\u0026rsquo;s not a good news for the people who rely on their works, because we all broke God\u0026rsquo;s law one way or another.\nBut what people believed is that it is all about your works. You get blessing for obedience and curses for disobedience. That having the law justifies you.\nSo following Paul\u0026rsquo;s logic, which were foreign to them, they would go down that \u0026ldquo;what if\u0026rdquo; rabbit hole and pose a question. That if my sins show how good God is. That despite my faithlessness He is still faithful, that despite of my wrongdoing He still keeps His promises. Then we can say that my sin bring glory to God. And when God get\u0026rsquo;s glorified it\u0026rsquo;s a good thing, right? Which means my works glorified God, and it is very good. And if I\u0026rsquo;m doing a good thing, why I\u0026rsquo;m getting punished for that? It is unfair. So, Paul, you ether wrong and God not going to Judge His special people, or God is unfair to me.\nIf we will rephrase that statement it would sound like:\nIf God simply forgives sinners (Jewish or Gentile) without demanding perfect Law-keeping, is God still a just Judge?\nWe will be getting the long version of the answer throughout the entire book. But, short version is in the verse 6:\nRomans 3:6 ⁶By no means! For then how could God judge the world?\nBack in the day this argument did not required any explanation. Because both Paul and his opponents believed that God is coming to Judge the world. It was not even a question. No one argued that.\nWhat people argued is that God will judge Gentiles for their sins and justify Jews despite their sins. Because, one way or another they have glorified God. Weather though their obedience and faithfulness or though their disobedience and faithlessness God was glorified.\nBut it is only twisted human logic. That has nothing to do with actual truth. In such case God would not be able to judge no one. But we know that He WILL judge and he WILL render to everyone what they deserve.\nRomans 3:7,8 ⁷But if through my lie God\u0026rsquo;s truth abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?⁸And why not do evil that good may come? — as some people slanderously charge us with saying. Their condemnation is just.\nThis new teaching of FAITH vs WORKS were misunderstood, rejected and fought against by many Jews. Because it did not align with their view of the world. So, they would use rhetorical tools, distorting Paul\u0026rsquo;s words and meaning to make it sound like absolute noses. Because they didn\u0026rsquo;t want to believe, and more then that they would withhold others from believing. By spreading roomers and lie. They chose to obey unrighteousness and rejected the truth just as we read in chapter 1. And Unfortunately they were condemned for that.\nRomans 3:9 ⁹What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin,\nThis is the bottom line for this entire argument. No one is in the privileged state before God. We all under the sin. And there is only one way out of it. Living Faith. But this is the topic for the next week.\nReligion show surrender and give up to it\u0026rsquo;s successor - living faith. As humans we are good at creating retrials, systems and religions. And we might easily slip into the trap of religious faith.\nToday Holy Spirit fights the same battle in me and you. As he did in the hearts of the Christians of the first century. Because we, the people, we would do anything in order to avoid building relationships with God. To this day, some \u0026ldquo;Christians\u0026rdquo; drift away from truth in to Judaism, in to other stuff. Why? Because they have no relationships with God. Because, they rely on logic and someonelses experiences.\nJustification is not in belonging, in logic, rhetoric\u0026rsquo;s or works. It\u0026rsquo;s not about being good person. Having high moral standards and being vocal about it.\nTHE ENEMIES OF THE LIVING FAITH - that\u0026rsquo;s what we talking about. And this week it is logic and tradition, but there is more. There is a battle in you. Between Holy Spirit and Tradition. Maybe you grew up in strong Pentacostal tradition and it\u0026rsquo;s shaped the way you follow God. Maybe a Baptist tradition left it\u0026rsquo;s blueprint. Catholic, Ortodox it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter.\nGod put you into His Church tonight to go back to the source. To go back to the Living Faith. To leave the bondage of the tradition. And it can be hard. It was not easy for Jewish believers back in the Paul\u0026rsquo;s day, not because they were bad people. But because they grew up with their tradition. Generation after generation. And it occupied a lot of their head space. Same with me and you. We tent to protect our tradition. We use logic and rhetoric\u0026rsquo;s. We do all the same things as people back in the day.\nBut we are not called into tradition. We called into relationships. Into the family of God.\nMarriage example We can compare it to the marriage. It\u0026rsquo;s not gonna be fully accurate. But it is very close to the truth, so, please bear with me. Growing up in your family you observe your mom and dad. They teach you verbally or non verbally about what the marriage is and how it works. Your view of the relationships getting derived from what you lived through as a kid. And then, you grow up and enter your own relationship. And it very well might happen that you start to treat your loved one in the ways you saw in your family. You have all this prejudges and assumption that you both carried over from your parents relationships. Good and Bad. And often they get in the way. Often they are the reason for the conflicts. Even when you don\u0026rsquo;t see it.\nAnd now you have a choice. You can be stubborn and keep doing what you doing. Because you know it is right. Because, you saw it in your family and your parents are still together. And that\u0026rsquo;s not easy life. And far not all relationships can survive that. Especially if that\u0026rsquo;s the choice on the both sides. And we all have fallen for that at some point.\nOr you can leave those experiences, that framework. And start getting to know your spouse. Start building YOUR own relationship instead of utilizing someone else\u0026rsquo;s. And of course there is room for error. And that\u0026rsquo;s why you should have people would help you not to do stupid and sometimes dangerous mistakes.\nMaybe it never happened to you. But I\u0026rsquo;ve been subjected to that. When I was Yang and Stupid. Someone tells you or you just have this idea in your head:\n\u0026ldquo;that\u0026rsquo;s how it should be, this is how it works. What you have is not right\u0026rdquo;.\nAnd you go and try to live by that only to figure out that it\u0026rsquo;s actually doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. That for your family it does more damage than good. Even though it worked for your parents in the past. Or it works for that other family. Not always you can take someone else\u0026rsquo;s experience, even if it\u0026rsquo;s a good one. And apply it to your situation. There is no work around of getting to know your loved one. It is a big part of the very reason for the relationships.\nWRAP UP Today we should pray and ask Holy Spirit to reveal to us His truth. Maybe today we should let go of some thing. Things that shape our view of God in a wrong way. Maybe there are things that does not help us in building up our Faith anymore. Religious way of thinking. When we rely on tradition. On our favorite authors and preachers to shape our image of God.\nWe should not rely on the tradition. We should leave religious way of thinking. And get to know our God. Though His word.\nJohn 8:31,32 ³¹So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, “If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples,³²and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”\n00:00:00 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/romans-3-1-8/","tags":null,"title":"Romans 3:1-8"},{"categories":null,"content":"Just as a recap. Last week we started on chapter 2 of the book of Romans. We read that what\u0026rsquo;s in my heart is more important then what\u0026rsquo;s on the surface. What\u0026rsquo;s in my heart will render out, it WILL effect my appearance, my conduct, my moral standards. And instead of focusing on the visible side of things, we should promote inner change, which come though our faith in Jesus Christ. Which comes though the work of the Holy Spirit.\nAnd today we will continue to drill into this chapter, as well as into the area of internal vs external. In this and the following chapter Holy Spirit through Paul lays down a new foundation, new \u0026ldquo;evaluation system\u0026rdquo; if you will, of one\u0026rsquo;s righteousness. Which is not actually \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo;, but I would referred to it as an original.\nTo get more holistic view of today\u0026rsquo;s topic we need to jump back a few verses. We will start reading from the verse 6:\nRomans 2:6-11 ⁶ He will render to each one according to his works:⁷to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life;⁸but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury.⁹There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek,¹⁰but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek.¹¹For God shows no partiality.\nYou know, we read this verses and it does sound appealing. Especially if you like me, who was born with a hypertrophied sense of justice. It ignites a little sparkle inside of you, that for once there will be some real justice.\nBut I think greater takeaways are that:\nFIRST. God WILL judge the world. It will actually happen but because it takes so long, some people start to believe that it will never happen for real. Because, Jesus were kinda hinted that it almost gonna be tomorrow but, here we are 2000 years later. And since it takes soooooooo long people stop considering it for real. And even if God will \u0026ldquo;judge\u0026rdquo; the world. At the end of the day He is so loving, He\u0026rsquo;ll forgive everyone anyway. Which is not what we read in the bible. God patiently waiting, giving us time to repent. We talked about it last week. But the day WILL COME. God will not only judge peoples works. BUT He will also judge secrets of man. God will judge secrets or κρυπτός [ kroop-tos\u0026rsquo;] as it is in original language. So, all who is in Crypto are in shambles right now)). But jokes aside, God will judge inward, hidden side of man. Some bible translations say, \u0026ldquo;judge thoughts\u0026rdquo; of people. So, our fist take away is that God WILL judge the world\nSecond takeaway is that not only God will judge the world, but he will RENDER to each one according to his works. And again idea that God will forgive anyone regardless of what they did does not align with the scriptures. Picture that people portray is that God will shake his finger at those who did not follow him, as a strict teacher. Telling them that they were naughty kids and that\u0026rsquo;s about as far as punishment will go. But what God\u0026rsquo;s word actually says is that: Those who obey the truth gonna get: eternal life, glory, honor and peace.\nBut those who obey unrighteousness will get wrath, fury, tribulation and distress.\nWhich category you wanna end up in? I really like the first one. It has everything I love. Peace, eternal life. I\u0026rsquo;m not too much into glory and honor to be honest, maybe some of you would think the same. But it is most likely because we treat this words differently this days. They do not mean the same to us as to original readers of the letter. Those were very important things in the time of Paul. Pretty much essential for life in community. Oversimplified explanation would be that it means that you will be treated with respect like an honorable person, and not just worthless slave.\nGod will render ACCORDINGLY to each one.\nThird takeaway. Which get\u0026rsquo;s really stressed out through the whole chapter. It is that God shows no partiality. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if you\u0026rsquo;ve noticed, but again and again Paul says something along the lines \u0026ldquo;to the Jew first, but also the Greek\u0026rdquo;. It is very, very important. Remember that the standard way of following God was Judaism. And for many Jewish followers of Christ, it was pretty standard view of the world. To belong to God and be the Jew was pretty much the same thing. Every Jew considered himself a part of God\u0026rsquo;s promise, based on the national factor. Based on them being God\u0026rsquo;s special people. Having his law and etc.\nWhich means other nations are not part of God\u0026rsquo;s promises by default. Because they are NOT his special people. Because they do not have \u0026ldquo;the law\u0026rdquo;.\nAnd true following and salvation is only possible threw knowing/following the law AND becoming a Jew.\nKeep that in mind as we read forward.\nRomans 2:12-29 ¹²For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.¹³For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified.¹⁴For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.¹⁵They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them¹⁶ on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.\nBelieve me or not but this was a revolutionary statement for the Paul to make. The idea that God will judge everyone in the same way was something that we would call a new revolution. This passage answers few questions for us. It shows us the justice of God. But also it brings us all, Jews and Gentiles into the same position before God.\nEveryone will get what they deserve according to their works.\nSome people ask:\n\u0026ldquo;How God is going to judge those, who never heard about Him? It unfair to judge them, because they didn\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo;\nIn this passage bible sheds some light on this issue. We all have knowledge of what is right. We have our conscience and even more then that. The ancient writers referred to this phenomena as \u0026ldquo;unwritten law\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;law that is written on the heart\u0026rdquo;. Internal moral compass that lead man to what is good. Ever one of us have one of this.\nBible clearly say that creation screams about God. Pointing out to it\u0026rsquo;s creator if we willing to pay attention. We have to plug or ears and close our eyes in order to not notice all that. People constantly having to come up with clever(or sometimes not so clever) ideas of why certain things are certain way, in order to avoid admitting that there is God who thoughtfully created this world. We talked about all that in previous Sundays.\nAnd today we see that God not only left the evidence of Him around us. He also left the evidence inside of us. And therefore we have no excuse when we do evil, even if we don\u0026rsquo;t have God\u0026rsquo;s written law. Because this internal compass points to the truth, that we are not doing right, and we chose to ignore it. And then our conscience accuses us, because we went against something we knew was right.\nAs for those who had God\u0026rsquo;s written law. They will be judged accordingly to that law. But judged never the less.\nBecause God does not respect outwardly circumstances of the man. He does not look at the face, nation, social status, power of wealth. He shows no partiality.\nExample Imagine the situation. There are two tradesman. Electricians. One is generational Electrician. He\u0026rsquo;s dad was electrician, same as he granddad. The guy went through collage and special training. He has a certificate. Probably more then one. He is considered qualified.\nAlso we have our second tradesman. He is nothing like that. He is just a self taught type. Who just watched other people work. And with trial an error kinda figured it our. He does not have generational experience and extensive education. But, he does work.\nThey both get hired to the work. Construction site is huge, so there is room for more then one worker. The first guy loughs when he sees seconds guy work. He pridefully comments on the things that he is not doing right. Going on an on about how they actually should be done. Using fancy terms like impedance, cross section, resistance an etc. He obviously knows about this work a lot more.\nBut one day they building get\u0026rsquo;s caught on fire. With the reason being that electrical work were done wrong. Insulation of the cables were damage during installation phase. Wrong type of fuses were used, as well as a wrong type of wire. Commission figures that both of the workers failed to do the job correctly, which ultimately lead to a fire. And now they are both under the trial. And both of them will be judged.\nBecause it is not knowing what needs to be done. But actually doing the work properly what matters. Same when with our life. It is not knowing what the bible says, but living according to the word what actually matters. And at the end of the day. If you failed at that your degrees will not matter. Your generational experience will not matter. All that does not counts. Because God shows no partiality that\u0026rsquo;s the third take away.\nSo our three highlight is that:\nGod WILL judge the secrets of man He will render according to the works Without partiality Romans 2:17-24 ¹⁷But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God¹⁸and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law;¹⁹and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,²⁰an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth —²¹ you then who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal?²²You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?²³You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law.²⁴For, as it is written, “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”\n²⁵For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.²⁶So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?²⁷Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law.²⁸For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical.²⁹But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God.\nHere we can see how the paces of the puzzle come together. We can see that justification does not come through knowledge. It does not come by belonging to a nation or the group of people. None of those outwardly things matter, if inwardly you are not born again.\nCircumcision was a sign of being devoted. People of Israel were separated from rest of the word. They were dedicated to God. They were called to be different. They were called to live by God\u0026rsquo;s standard regardless of what the world around them live by. They were called to be all those things from the verses 19 and 20. But kinda failed.\nToday we read that belonging to God\u0026rsquo;s holy people is not about national factor. It is not about the sign that you carry on your physical body. It is about your heart. Your heart should be devoted, dedicated to God. True people of God are circumcised at the heart level. Not the physical muscle that pumps the blood. Not that one. But your inward self. At the level of your mind and soul.\nWe can see that old way, old paradigm of following is fading away. That following God is not about belonging to the certain group of people. It\u0026rsquo;s not about knowing the rules.\nIt does not matter how long you go to the Church. It does not matter how well you know the bible. If you go against God\u0026rsquo;s word. If you do not live by it, all those other things are done in vain. Today we live in different times. But we face the same challenge. The message remains relevant.\nIf we focus on outwardly matters. When we become merely religious people. \u0026ldquo;Do the right thing\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;come to church\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Do that, don\u0026rsquo;t do this\u0026rdquo;.\nLike one minister said to a yang lady in the Church(not our Church). \u0026ldquo;You should not wear this and thins on Sundays. But how you dress any other day does not matter\u0026rdquo;.\nBehave properly in the Church and what you do on the week day does not matter. Slowly but surly this approach will trains us to create an \u0026ldquo;church appropriate version of ourselves\u0026rdquo; which we put up when among the Christians. And then when we leave the church we turn into a completely different creature.\nHow many stories of a fathers who are close to \u0026ldquo;as holy as Jesus\u0026rdquo; state while in the Church. They do the right thing, talk the right talks. But then go home and abuse and bit up wife and children. I\u0026rsquo;ve heard this more then once.\nPeople learned the \u0026ldquo;rules of the game\u0026rdquo;. And now while they at the church they simply play their role. For some it might be so natural that we do not even notice it anymore.\nFriends, Church in not a theater. We not gathering to \u0026ldquo;do the right thing\u0026rdquo; for once. Our gatherings should not be religious habit, which we practice to keep God happy. We are not called to be religious. Religion does not save people. Being religious did not help Jews not gonna help you.\nFor no one is a Christian who is merely one outwardly, nor is the following outward and physical.\nCircumcision of your heart by the Spirit, that\u0026rsquo;s what we after. That\u0026rsquo;s what pleases God. Inward change that renders out. And today is the time to start. Because God WILL judge the world. And you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be on the wrong side when that happens.\n00:00:00 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/romans-2-12-29/","tags":null,"title":"Romans 2:12-29"},{"categories":null,"content":"God is the righteous judge. We continue our journey through the book of Romans. And today we up to chapter two. The issues that we will discuss today, are very old but in the same time still very relevant. You see, apparently not everything improves over time. Even with science and psychology rapidly advancing, today we face the same issues people have had over 2000 years ago. Because our hearts are fundamentally broken and without God and his guidance we never gonna be able to overcome those issues. So, let\u0026rsquo;s be sensitive to a Holy Spirit tonight and let\u0026rsquo;s let God change our way of thinking as we dive into his word.\nSTART THE TIMER WILL YOU? Last week we read about Paul describing the state of the society. Explaining how did people end up in such poor state. Interestingly enough we can observe that our societies not too much different 2000 years after. And it is very important observation. Why? Because, our society still rejects God. Our educational system claims that people came out of monkeys. There were very primitive and stupid and developed over time. And only the smartest would survive and that is why WE ARE the smartest people ever existed. And those lost tribes who still leave in the jungles hardly having any culture or language are the proof. And therefore there is no God. And therefore WE ARE \u0026ldquo;Gods\u0026rdquo; and shell worship ourselves only.\nBut we can see that Bible argues otherwise. There is an alternative view, or shell we say original view. That when people refuse to submit to God and acknowledge and worship him, they step away form wisdom and degraded. They roll back to the primitive state. Just as we read last week. And those tribes ARE the proof. They are an example of what happens to the society that do not worship God. And we can see all the signs of rebel again God in the world around us today. Lat\u0026rsquo;s look again at verses 29 to 32 of the chapter 1\nRomans 1:29-32 29 They are filled with every kind of sin, evil, greed, and hatred. They are full of jealousy, murder, fighting, lying, and thinking the worst things about each other. They gossip 30 and say evil things about each other. They hate God. They are rude, proud, and brag about themselves. They invent ways of doing evil. They don’t obey their parents, 31 they are foolish, they don’t keep their promises, and they show no kindness or mercy to others. 32 They know God’s law says that anyone who lives like that should die. But they not only continue to do these things themselves, but they also encourage others who do them.\nPerfect description of the state of the world isn\u0026rsquo;t it? We CAN SEE all this things. They are easy quit identify and point your finger at. This is how the society of the day of Paul were. And a lot of same attitudes is in the world today. This is what you see looking out of our church window. Right? Last Sunday we talked about corruption. Corruption of minds of individuals and corruption of the society as a whole.\nExample But you now what. There is a hope for this world! Not everyone are as bed as verses 29-32 of chapter 1 describe. Praise God I\u0026rsquo;m nothing like that! I go to church at least twice a month, I\u0026rsquo;m a regular fella. I pray every day(almost). Sometimes I even read the bible. And you know what? I give tithe! God should be happy with me. Praise God I\u0026rsquo;m not like those sinners.\nEver though that? Of course not. But there were a parable that Jesus told people:\nLuke 18:10-14 ¹⁰“Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.¹¹The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.¹² I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.’¹³But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’¹⁴I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”\nReading this we can see 2 different ways to approach your righteousness, shell we say. This parable is somewhat relevant to our topic today so, please keep it in mind.\nThe Problem Back in the day as well as now society were in the bad state before God. But on the other hand the Church of the day had a problem too. The stumbling block which to this day tripping people over. Moralism that goes hand in hand with Hypocrisy:\nRomans 2:1 ¹Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start from an easy one a Hypocrite: * A hypocrite is someone who preaches one thing but does another—they don’t live by the same rules they impose on others.\nWho is Moralist? A moralist is a person who:\nBelieves in and promotes a strict set of moral principles, often focusing on what is right and wrong behavior(underlined).\nJudges others based on moral standards, especially concerning issues of conduct, ethics, or propriety.\nMay sometimes be seen as overly concerned with morality, especially in a judgmental or preachy way.\nMoralism \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Hypocrisy. Dangerous mixture. And unfortunately churches are historically known to be subjected to this issue. Jesus often criticized Pharisees for exactly that. But it is not specific to any particular nation or people group. Let\u0026rsquo;s see the verse 1 again:\nRomans 2:1 ¹Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges.\nYou see, it were not exclusive to Jewish believers only, as some might argue. No, this is the disease that can affect anyone.\nHigh moral standards are good Let\u0026rsquo;s clarify that high moral standards are NOT Evil. God sets this standards. And those who live in God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom should strive to adhere to His expectations. To be more like our Father. Those standards, as we call them, are simply are guard rails that do not let us hurt ourselves and others. So, it not like we try to be good boys and girls to keep our God happy, behaving appropriately at the church and if we particularly holy in public too. While on the inside burning with all kinds of desires. Rotting inside out. No, that\u0026rsquo;s not the goal. Our behavior should be a representation of our inner change. Outer state, our conduct, our behavior, should reflect inner state, state of our heart. Not the other way around.\nExample If I\u0026rsquo;m staying loyal to my spouse because \u0026ldquo;God says so\u0026rdquo;. And I\u0026rsquo;m hiding and suppressing desires that live inside of me. Try to be a good boy. It will work for a time, but then it will collapse.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like cheap renovation. If you paint a good paint over a rusty surface, it will stick for a little bit, but it is going to fall off very soon exposing that rust again. This is not the way to fix it.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s keep reading:\nRomans 2:1-3 For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things.²We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who practice such things.³Do you suppose, O man — you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself — that you will escape the judgment of God?\nMoralist expects right behavior on the outside. Condemning others for their visible sins. He can point his finger at those people and say \u0026ldquo;How could they do that?\u0026rdquo;. It is so wrong, I would never do anything like that. But, reality is that the state of his, moralist\u0026rsquo;s heart IS THE SAME as heart of the person he condemns. He commits the same kid of sin he judges others for. Maybe in a slightly less obvious way. In secret. The moralist\u0026rsquo;s math is broken. In their math 1/2 != 0.5. In their judgments the sentence is greatly depends on WHO is under the trial. Is it me, or someone else?\nAnd every one of us prone to such attitude. And you can find yourself on that route. It is an easy one. It is so easy to judge others and justify yourself. Having a good excuse why YOUR sin is not as bed, why it does not count. Or even better, you can stay blind to your own flaws. But then, one day. If God is good to you, one day you will find yourself doing exactly the same things you judged other for. And then, if you are able to be humble, you will say \u0026ldquo;God, be merciful to me, a sinner!\u0026rdquo;.\nRIGHTLY FALLS Paul says that the judgment of God RIGHTLY falls on THOSE WHO PRACTICE such things(those things that we read in the chapter 1). ALL those who practice. Sometimes when we slip into a state of moralism and hypocrisy. We somehow think that God looks at our sin differently than on the sin of the world. We think it is OK for me because:\nI\u0026rsquo;m a strong christian. Because I have knowledge. Because I\u0026rsquo;m not under the law. Because, I\u0026rsquo;m lead by the Spirit. Pick your favorite excuse, or you can suggest your own. We deceive ourselves if we think this way because judgment of God FALLS on those who practice. End of equation. There are no IF\u0026rsquo;s no additional or hidden conditions. The sin remains sin regardless of who commits it.\nWhy do we tent to think that our sin is somehow excused or that God treats our sins different?\nRomans 2:4,5 ⁴Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God\u0026rsquo;s kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?⁵But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God\u0026rsquo;s righteous judgment will be revealed.\nPresume [καταφρονέω] kataphronéō - κατά = down, against \u0026amp;\u0026amp; φρονέω = to think, to have an opinion or mindset\nMeaning: To look down on, despise or to treat with disrespect.\nGod\u0026rsquo;s kindness get\u0026rsquo;s treated with disrespect. Get\u0026rsquo;s miss interpret.\nExample with kids If you have kids, they illustrate this principle extremely well. They know the rules of the house. For example they know they not allowed to play screens on school days. They have their turn to do the dishes. They should not though their cloth and toys all over the place. They know all that. Simple, reasonable rules that make life together possible.\nBut they do break them. And as a parents we not always immediately in their face about it. We give them grace and time. You know, deep in your heart you hope that they will actually do those things, fix their cloth and do the dishes and what not. Maybe later they will get to it. But often they do not. You can see them playing screens when they not suppose too. You do not tell them right a way, to give them chance to stop it on their own. But instead more often then not they only start doing more of it.\nSomehow they do not appreciate you patience, they do not fix their behavior. Instead they interpret it as a permission to break the rules. Until the day of wrath as scriptures would call it. When judgment of the parents will RIGHTLY FALL on THOSE WHO PRACTICED such things.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you not know you not allowed to do screens?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;We know it\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you know you have to do XYZ?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;We know\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Then why don\u0026rsquo;t you do what you should?\u0026rdquo; And silence is the answer And your kindness and forbearance were interpret as a cancellation signal. As if all the rules suddenly changed. I bring out the example from the life of a parent. But it is not only true for kids.\nWe as God\u0026rsquo;s children is very good at this as well. In the same way God give us chance to fix our ways. To stop doing evil. And he delays the day of wrath. Giving us chance to repent. To turn away from the wrong things we do. But somehow because we haven\u0026rsquo;t been stroked by the lightning very second we did wrong, we interpret His kindness and forbearance and patience as a permission to go ahead and continue.\nWe all know the rules. We look at the world around us and condemn those people, we judge the wicked system. But what about our own hearts?\nSomehow we think that there is no more such thing as a sin for us. Because we going to church. Because we call ourselves \u0026ldquo;Christians\u0026rdquo;.\nExample We\u0026rsquo;ve seen examples of this when an unmerried couple live together, and they think they are OK with God, that they do not do anythings wrong, because they both consider themselves \u0026ldquo;Christians\u0026rdquo;, because they go to church. As if sin is not a sin anymore if you come to a certain building once a week for an hour and a half. No it is not.\nAnd if you think you can live in sin and be ok with God.\n1 John 2:4 ⁴Whoever says “I know him” but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him,\nBecause:\nRomans 2:6,11 ⁶ He will render to each one according to his works:¹¹For God shows no partiality.\nWe will leave this part for the next week. But as of today we remind ourselves:\nConclusion We are not called to be Moralists on Hypocrites. Our mission is not to promote, judge or be overly concerned with the right behavior. It is not what\u0026rsquo;s important. We should not put on a mask or a good Christian when we come to church and we definitely should not try pretend before God, because he knows our hearts anyway.\nBe real when you pray. If there is a problem in your heart. If you have have desires that God does not admire, tell God about it. Ask him for help. Have a trustworthy AND mature person in the Church(locally) to whom you can talk about it.\nYou can talk to a pastor. That\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m here for. But if that guys it too scary, you can talk to your more mature christian friend as well. Who will be able to support you in the prayer. Maybe hold you accountable. There is a great power in opening our secret struggles before one another. I experiences and can testify that it is true.\nWe should let God to change our hearts, change our way of thinking, and those changes will reflect on the outside. And we would not have to force ourselves to do the right thing. We will have very little or no desire to do the bad things.\nMoral standards do not save or change people. Following rules do not save or change people. Doing good works do not save people and not nesseserly change people. Faith in Jesus Christ saves people. Repentance and being born again that\u0026rsquo;s what changes people. Love that what changes people.\n00:00:00 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/romans-2-1-11/","tags":null,"title":"Romans 2:1-11"},{"categories":null,"content":"Intro Last time we spent a lot of time looking at the context of the book and less time reading the scriptures. Today we will try to do the opposite. There are still few important historical mentions that we need to consider in order to better understand the application and the meaning of the scriptures. In case you were not here last Sunaday let me quickly summarize what we talked about.\nSummery of last Sunday Last time we looked at the historical background of the letter to the church(es) in the city of Rome. We talked about Saul of Tarsus and how he relates to the story. We also looked at formation of the church in Rome. And little bit of what the church been going through, what kind of challenges they have experienced at the time of the letter. Today we might expand on that a little bit more, but before we will do that let\u0026rsquo;s start with our scriptures.\nRomans 1:1-17 ¹Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,²which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,³concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh⁴and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,⁵through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations,⁶including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,\n⁷To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints:\nGrace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\nRecap of the verse 1 As a recap from the last week, in the beginning of his letter Paul introduces himself and also provides the prove of his authority and expertise. We figured that Paul indeed have all the authority to speak into the life of the church in Rome, even though he did not start it. And this letter speaks to us as much as to it\u0026rsquo;s original receivers. Paul is a messenger of God, who were divinely appointed, sent forth with orders from the master.\nWhy he talks about Gospel? Starting from the verse 2 Paul starts to preset the Gospel or the Good News, that he is a servant off. Why would he do that? He writes to the church that exists for a number of years. Church that is active and famous in the Christian circles? There might be several reasons. But I want to focus on the one I believe to be the major. And to explain it well I need to start from a far. So, please bear with me for a moment.\nThe problem Christian movement of the first century were rapidly growing among the Jews as well as among non-Jewish cultures. And that presented a problem, which in our days we don\u0026rsquo;t even consider. The problem were \u0026ldquo;what to do with the non Jewish believers?\u0026rdquo;. You might have a question, \u0026ldquo;What do you mean by that?\u0026rdquo; But If you thing about it for the moment, you will see the root of the issue.\nJewish roots Jesus and his disciples were Jews. There were born in that culture. They followed their traditions like Circumcision, rules about the food, law of Moses, observing the Sabbath and other Religious celebrations. That all was a part of their life. And Jesus never spoke against those things. He never taught people or his disciples that they should stop following those traditions, culture and religion. As some believed and falsely accused Jesus of it. In fact this is what the Jesus said:\nMatthew 5:17 ¹⁷ “Do not think that I have come to abolish(destroy) the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.\nSo, in the minds of Jewish people if anyone would want to come and follow their God. And at that point they have had a exclusive rights to follow God. They were His special people. His nation. It was possible, but whoever want\u0026rsquo;s to worship God, have to become a Jew. Which means: Get circumcised, start observing the law and etc. It was pretty standard approach that worked for hundreds of years. And that is exactly how apostles thought as well. Peter \u0026ldquo;the rock\u0026rdquo; who was the head of the church, had this view for a quite some time. John and others too. Any regular Jew, and especially those who knew the law well would think that. Not because they are bed people. But because that was the only available option from the perspective of the Holy Scriptures for a hundreds if not thousands of years. People did not even thought that there could be other options. And therefore it was a standard position of a Jewish follower of Christ. If you want to follow Christ. If you want to be a part of this hope, this wonderful promise. You need to follower everything else as well. You have to be a Jew in all regards.\nSome Numbers Let me give you some number to help you understand the scale. Jesus died at the year AD 30 - 33. Approximately. That\u0026rsquo;s when the church were born. This is timing of Acts 2, when Peter preaches and 3000 people get baptized at one day. And every day after that more people start joining the church. They all were Jews. They gathered at the temple every day. Which clearly points out that they have not changed their traditions a bit. Then, after persecution on the Church in Jerusalem people flee. They went home to their cites all over the place and founded local communities there. This is when, most likely church in Rome were started as well. But remember it\u0026rsquo;s still were all Jews. With their Jewish mindset and worldview. And only at the year AD 48–50. Which is 17 years later. We have Acts chapter 15 when Church officially makes up it\u0026rsquo;s mind about non Jewish believers. Just think about, first 17 years. It\u0026rsquo;s a loong time. But then, even after the council in Jerusalem, after church \u0026ldquo;officially allowed\u0026rdquo; non Jewish believers not to be converted to Judaism to follow Christ, it took a loooong time to spread this news around. And even longer to make people accept this, and change their mind.\nNew Theology So, when the apostle Paul came up with a new way of thinking. Which we will see in the moment. But simply pot it is that salvation comes by the faith alone. It have created controversy among the Jewish believers. Many people rejected this idea. It went against everything they ever knew and believed. There were apposed.\nThere were talks and rumors about Paul\u0026rsquo;s teaching. Because, you know, because people didn\u0026rsquo;t even heard Paul\u0026rsquo;s teaching. They would rely on sources of information like \u0026ldquo;Bro told me that the guy he knew heard Paul saying X\u0026rdquo;. Misinterpretation, misrepresentation and attempts to compromise Paul and his words have taken place. Not nesseserly because Jewish believers were all that bad. No, simply because those ideas, \u0026ldquo;being God\u0026rsquo;s special nation and having exclusive access to God\u0026rdquo; were solidified in their minds over the Generations. To set be set apart for God was equal to be a Jew. Which was equal to follow the tradition. And in his letter Paul takes the opportunity to clarify to the Jewish believers and Gentiles his position. What is this Gospel he is teaching. Not because they did not know Gospel, but to assure them that His Gospel is the same Gospel they believed. And he starts to build the foundation to prove his position to be true and illuminate that controversy.\nRomans 1:3-6 ³concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh⁴and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,⁵through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations,⁶including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,\nIn this scriptures we see very condensed story of Jesus the messiah. Only the most important key points, to prove that he is not preaching some other Gospel. He, Paul, is preaching Jesus who were Jew according to flesh. He is descended from David exactly like God is promised in the Holy Scriptures. But also he is Son of God, which were proved by his resurrection. This is Gospel, Good News that we all believed. Jews and Gentiles. Paul reminds that though Jesus we received grace. We received salvation. And also, same Jesus, appointed him to be his apostle, to do his work. Paul reminds us that he has the authority, that comes from the Master. That the work he is doing is not his, but it is the work of God, and Paul is just a worker. And the work is to take the Gospel to ALL NATIONS. Gospel of Jesus Christ should not bounded by any particular tradition. Not Jewish, not Pentecostal, not Baptist, not even Orthodox or Catholic. Gospel of Jesus Christ has to travel to all nations, all people groups. That\u0026rsquo;s what God desire.\nAnd that is what God appointed Paul to do. And gave him authority which include ALL those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.\nRomans 1:8-12 ⁸First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world.⁹ For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you¹⁰always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God\u0026rsquo;s will I may now at last succeed in coming to you.¹¹For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you —¹²that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other\u0026rsquo;s faith, both yours and mine.\nIn this scriptures Paul assures us that he does not favor one group above the other. He says \u0026ldquo;I thank God for all of you. Bringing our attention to what\u0026rsquo;s unites us, rather then what divides. He says \u0026ldquo;your faith is proclaimed in all the world\u0026rdquo;. What does he mean by that?\nTo be christian in Rome Being devoted Christian in Rome was not an easy task. Unlike other places, in the city of Rome Christians were not in a big favor. Often there were pretty much considered the enemies of the state. So, the churches in Rome had to be strong and devoted in their faith in order to be able to withstand all the troubles that came their way. Both Jews and Gentiles. And this was a common denominator between all believers in Roman Churches and also Paul himself.\nWe know about many horrible thing Paul had to go through while preaching the Gospel. And I think I\u0026rsquo;m safe to say that scriptures does not provide a comprehensive list of his \u0026ldquo;adventures\u0026rdquo;. And also, there were more troubles ahead. That Paul already anticipated. And often apostle were surrendered by those who could not really understand his life, and what he have to go through. You know, when you went through some difficulties in your life. And I\u0026rsquo;m talking about truly heavy things. People, who understand you the best, and usually people who are able to empathize, comfort and encourage you, usually are those who had similar experiences. And I believe that is what Paul was looking forward too. That\u0026rsquo;s what he is talking about in verses 11 and 12. He have some spiritual gift, the knowledge and revelation that he would gladly share with the church in Rome. And they can truly understand the life Paul lived. They can empathize and support Paul. Because, they would often go though similar experiences.\nPaul assuring Romans that they are dear to his heart. That he proud of them and that he consider them mature, so much so that when he comes he anticipates to not only serve and give, but also to receive. To get strengthen and encouraged. He reminds that they share the same faith. Again pointing out to the things that unite, not divide.\nRomans 1:13-15 ¹³I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles.¹⁴ I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.¹⁵So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.\nGentiles In the verses 13 to 17 we can see Paul assuring people in the church that he is not at all avoiding coming to Rome. That the only reason he did not visited them so far were outer obstacles. At the end of the letter he will reveal to us the true reason and nature of what was preventing him. And as much as his desires go. Paul have many times intended to visit Rome. But, God had other plans for him.\nAlso, we can see that in the beginning of the letter it seems like Paul addressed believers of a Jewish background a little more. You can notice it in the language he uses. Referring to the Holy Scriptures, that had great authority and a lot of weight for Jews. And was way less important for Gentiles. And in this section his language changes a bit. He stats to talk more plainly. Reassuring listeners that in his ministry of preaching the Gospel he not bound by national factor. Level of literacy or wisdom. Gospel is available for everyone. It is not privatized by any nation, tradition or the group of people.\nRomans 1:16-17 ¹⁶For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.¹⁷For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.”\nKeys Verses 16 and 17 are keys to the new view of the world. \u0026ldquo;The righteous shall live by faith\u0026rdquo;. This is the core of Paul\u0026rsquo;s teaching. This is why we can have a church gathering in the format we understand. This is what set\u0026rsquo;s gospel free of tradition. \u0026hellip;to everyone who believes!. Both for Jews and Greeks(Gentiles). Please, notice it does not exclude Jews. It does not say that it is only for those Jews who stop following the law, as some people trying to say. No, it is for all who believe in Good News of Jesus Christ.\nWe can see that two worldviews were merged in this verses. Logic and Holy Scriptures says that Gospel brings salvation to EVERYONE who BELIEVES. To the Jew first BUT also to the Greek.Yes, Gospel came from Jews and though Jews and we cannot and should not discount that. But, the Good news of Jesus Christ did not stop there. It went into the nations. It is for everyone who have faith.\nApplication We should take a new look at the salvation and appreciate that God was so kind to release it into the nations without the burden of tradition. We also should not impose our tradition when we preach the Gospel. Gospel is the Good News about the Jesus Christ, Son of God whom he rose from the dead. And now though Jesus we can have forgiveness of our sins. There is place for traditions in every fellowship and there is time to honor those. But let\u0026rsquo;s not bond those to the Gospel. Let\u0026rsquo;s quite looking down on other Christian confessions. And rather take the gospel to the people who actually never heard it. There were times when the believers in the church have different views and both parties consider themselves to be right. On our Men\u0026rsquo;s bible studies on Wednesdays, sometimes guys getting very passionate about things, and not always agree with one another. Which can create room for the enemy to make a division. And split the church. And hurt the work of the Lord. But, instead of claiming to be right, and call out others for being wrong, we should be looking into things that unite us, and not divide. Just as apostle Paul did.

All Scriptures are inspired by God and good for learning, so no matter were we settle there is some important truth for us! God always speaks to our lifes if we willing to listen, so for the some time we will anchor into the Pauls letter to the church in the city of Rome. This one stands out among other letters writen by Paul. It can be considered a little bit more special, so I\u0026rsquo;m exited to start digging into God\u0026rsquo;s truth with you!\nFoundation But before we will go ahead and dive into the text, we should lay a foundation that might help us to understand scriptures a little dipper, or perhaps I should say a little easier. Why certain things are talked about and some are not, why is the Holy Spirit say sertain thing sertain way and etc. Probably it is not going to revolutionize your view of the text. Even though for some people it might be eyes opening, especially if you never considered that context before. But it is certainly can help to comprehand the scriptures. And in some cases prevents misreading.\nWhy we neex context? We will start from the overview of the book and some historical background. Why? Because this additional knowledge can unlock your understanding of the certain aspects of the text. How to apply them and so on.\nBecause written word can be tricky. It can suffer the lacks of context. Emotions of the writer, his intentsions and etc. Which otherwise are pretty apparent when you talk face to face. Or easily clarified just by asking a person. Unlike live conversation, letters has only words. And depending on many factors you can interprite the same words differently. As social networks and messaging apps gained popularity it became very clear.\nImpersise language Many times I found myself in the position where I wrote a little message to someone. Said something pretty innocent. Maybe a little joke or what not. But, on the other end of the conversation, person misread it and got hurt. Got very offended. And then you have to deal with a conflict that would have not even happen if you would just talk in person.\nSo, the context is very, very important. And that is exactly why we will spend some times to acumulate this additional knowledge at the start of the book.\nWho Is Paul Book of Romans where written by an Apostle Paul. Formerly known as a Saul of Tarsus. He were a Jewish rabby. Who passionately observed and followed the law of Moses and Jewish traditions. He was one of the brightest teachers of the law of his day. And I think if he would continue to pursue that career, he would easily get to the teepety top of the corporate ladder. He was extremely smart. Very devoted. He knew how to work hard. His teachers were the best of the best. He got it all.\nHowever Saul of Tarsus viewed Jesus of Nathareth and His followers as the threat to everything he was so passionate about. And with all his passion he started to work against that movement. He tried as hard as he can to cast it into oblivion. Persecuting and destroying individuals, families and entire communities. Once he shattered the church of Christ in Jerusalem. He went into trouble of getting permissions to do the same in the other cities.\nHis next target were the city of Damascus. And on his way to Damascus Saul had very dramatic experience. He met with the Lord Jesus. It was an encounter that changed Saul\u0026rsquo;s life. He turned from the main enemy of the Gospel to one of the major messengers. From being one who were persecuting people for their faith in Jesus Christ, to the one who were persecuted for the same faith. And from there on we know him as apostle Paul.\nGod have used his knowledge and passion to start Christian Churches all over Roman Empire. He were pretty famous figure. Largely respected in Christian communities. But not everyone looked up to Paul. There were some people and entire groups of believers who have questioned Paul\u0026rsquo;s authority. So, apostle Paul had his own share of troubles and challenges.\nAt the time he writes his letter to Church in Rome. He did not yet visited this community in person. And even though he had friend and co-workers who moved to live in Rome. Not everyone were familier with who he is.\nChurch in Rome It is not clear how exactly church in Rome were formed, but the most common version is that the Jews who were in Jerusalem at the day of Pentecost(discribed in Acts 2) and have repented. Returned back home to the city of Rome and formed the church there. But also I believe that there were others who have heard Paul\u0026rsquo;s preaching in different part of the Roman empire and then joined the local church in Rome.\nBecause, remember places were the apoustol Paul went, often were trending centers, religious centers or sport centers of the day. And people who heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ preached by Paul(or by others) could have come from all over the Roman empire and beyond. Later those people would returne home and joine(or form) their local Christian communities.\nSo Church(or should I say churches) in Rome were a mix match of Jewish and Gentile believers. At the time of the letter church already existed for a number of years. It was active and famous in christian world. And unlike other letters of Paul. In his letter to the church in Rome he does not address any particular issue or problem. He\u0026rsquo;s main goal is to encorage the church. He presents comprehensive version of the Gospel. And expressed hope to not only visit them, but also that they will help him with his further ministry to those who do not know about Christ in Spain.\nEven though Paul does not address any particular issues in his letter. He does spent considerable part of his letter helping Jewish and Non-Jewish believers to settle their arguments. We will address this topic once we get there but, short version is that most lickly church have started as primaraly Jewish. And non-Jew believers were the minority and were largely overlooked. Due to the Jewish culture and tradition of the day (them being special nation).\nThen under the reign of the emperor Claudius all Jews were expelled from the city of Rome. And were allowed to return only 5 years later. When they got back to their homes and churches. They have found that at this point church consist primerly of non-Jewish believers and now Jews were overlooked and undervalued. So people in the church with different backgrounds would argue about the traditions and the law. About what should be followed and how things should be. So Paul, as a Jewish rabby on one side and apostile for Gentiles on the other helps them to settle thier arguments and find path of love and peace.\nAt the moment of the writing Paul was located at the city of Corinth, during his third missionary journey. In the city of Corinth believers struggled to respect Paul as an apostile. Also, they have struggled with all kids of immoral behaviors and pagan believes. And that is what Paul had to deal with at the time and those obsticles also could have their influence on the letter to Rome.\nPaul\u0026rsquo;s introduction So, with all that being said. Let\u0026rsquo;s start reading.\nRomans 1:1-8 ¹Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,²which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,³concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh⁴and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,⁵through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations,⁶including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,\n⁷To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints:\nGrace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\nPaul starts his letter to the churches of Rome from, classical greetings section. Back in the day that\u0026rsquo;s was a pretty standart way to write the letter. But, besides formal greetings he also says a couple extra things. One of which is that Paul introduces himself. As I already mentioned earlied Paul did not started the church in Rome. And therefore people could have questions like WHO IS PAUL? And what he has to do with our fellowship?\nWhen you introduce yourself to a new group of people, that what you usually do. You say your name and then who you are. You present your identity or credatioals in a very condensed form, in a singular word of a centanse.\nOur presentation back home When me and my falmily go back home. We often visit different churches and share about our ministry here in Batumi. And that is very regular thing you have to do. You go up on the stage(if it\u0026rsquo;s a church gathering) or you maybe just sit a bit more upright if it is a less formal group. And you say something among the lines \u0026ldquo;Hello, my name is Viktar. And for the last 15 years me and my wife serve God as a missionaries\u0026rdquo;\nConferance Inviroment In the conferance inviroment a persone would get up on the stage and say: \u0026ldquo;Hi, my name is Tim. I worked at X for the last 10 years. In cyber secyrity departement and today I\u0026rsquo;m gonna talk about most common volnurabilities in modern web applications.\u0026rdquo;\nSo, the person presents himself and also presents his credentials. He proves his experties and gives us reasons to respect his oppinions. He proves that he really knows his field.\nPresentation of Paul Let\u0026rsquo;s see how does apoustol Paul presents himself.\nHe says: \u0026ldquo;Hello, I\u0026rsquo;m Paul and I am a servant of the Chris Jesus\u0026rdquo;.\nThe word \u0026ldquo;servant\u0026rdquo; as it translated in ESV bible. In original text sounds like \u0026ldquo;δοῦλος\u0026rdquo; - [doolos] - which translates as a slave. Or one devoted to another to the disregard of one\u0026rsquo;s own interests.\nPaul\u0026rsquo;s presents himself as a slave of Jesus Christ. Litterally says that \u0026ldquo;I do not belong to myself. I disregarded my own will and I\u0026rsquo;m fully devoted to the will of my master\u0026rdquo;.\nHe continues:\nRomans 1:1 ¹Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle\u0026hellip;\nThe word called translates as \u0026ldquo;invited\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;divinely selected and appointed\u0026rdquo;.Paul, have been devinely selected and appointed to be an apostle. Jesus Christ himself desided that Paul should be one of his special people, apostles. Who is the apostle? Apostle is a delegate, messenger, or the one sent forth with orders.\nHere Paul presents us his authority. Provides the reasons why we should listen to him. And as you see it is NOT because he is very smart. NOT because he has a PhD. NOT because he was taught by the best theachers of the law. NOT because he is exceptionally good at all things God\u0026rsquo;s law. None of that. Paul had all those credentials, but he not using thouse as a proof of this experties if you will.\nHis authority does not come from him. His authority comes from the fact that he is a servant or a slave of the Jesus Christ, who were apointed to be his messenger, special worker. Paul were sent with orders from the master. And whatever Pauls says. He does not say on his own behalf. But on the behalf of the one who sent him.\nHe disregarded his own will and fully devoted to the will of his Master. So, his authority comes from his belonging to the master.\nExample #1 Imagine, you walking down the street. The day is really good. Sun shining on you, slight wind blows into your face. You go about your bisness enjoing the moment. And then suddenly some guy on the street stats talking to you. You don\u0026rsquo;t really understand what he is saying. You, as a polite persone would, smile and say sorry, I don\u0026rsquo;t have time. And keep walking. The guy behing you demand you to stop, but you not even thinking about it. Happened to me few times. I\u0026rsquo;m sure some of you have had simmilar expiriance. No problem what so ever.\nExample #2 But let me share with you the other story that happen to me some time ago. Maybe year or two back. Everything was pretty much like in the first case. Nice day, beautiful weather. And the guy\u0026hellip; actulay two of them. With the differance being that they had a Police uniform. They asked me to stop and I did. They asked me some questions and I aswered. They\u0026rsquo;ve asked me to open my backpack and I obeyed. I did this not because Gocha and Merab told me. No, but because officers Beridze and Kochalidze requested it. While they are on duty they act not on their own behalf, but on the behalf of the state. State grants them authority. And if you do not obey, you gonna get charges pushed against you. Not because you did\u0026rsquo;t listen to Gocha and Merab, no, but because while they on the duty they represent their \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo; the state of Georgia. And disobeying them is the same as disobeying their master.\nSame with apostle Paul. In his work he does not represents himslelf. He does not speak of himself. He is apointed by the master to do the work. And as long as he is on duty, you should listen to what he is saying. Because disobeying him is the same as disobeying the master who sent him.\nWhy it is important? Why we spend some much time talking about things that at the first look are not important and obvious.\nBecause, back in the day, as well as now there are people who doubds Pauls authority. People saying that you should only obey things that Jesus spoke himself, but whatever apostles sayed is not so important, they could have been wrong. They are just people after all.\nYes, they were just regular, everyday people. But those pepole were selected and apointed by God to speak on his behalf. God grants them authority and we should listen and submit. Because, apostles on duty spoke on behalf of God. And all that is written in the bible were inspired by the Holy Spirit. All scripture are good and inspired by God bible says. So, please, do not get trapped by the enemy, by your pride that says \u0026ldquo;You know better then them\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;You need no man to teach you\u0026rdquo;. It will set you up for the falure.\nNot only Pual is chosen by God to be his worker. But also he is not just any worker. Like a multitytool. He is a special instrument. Dedicated to one job.\nRomans 1:1 ¹Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,\nI love tools. I have a few. I know how to work with my hand and fix things, or at least I manage to make them less broken then they were before. And I have this nice multitool. It\u0026rsquo;s not a cheap knockoff. It\u0026rsquo;s a legit one. It\u0026rsquo;s a present from a friend. Solid, made in USA all that. And it does work. It is a handy thing. can be a knife, a saw, a pliers, screwdriver and more. But the moment you need to do something tiny bit more special that regular task, it not gonna help. As good as it is it\u0026rsquo;s going to be useless. But, I have other tools that are highly specialized. And I keep them in the box until the moment I need them. Because, when I need them nothing else will help. Yes, maybe they do one thing, but they do that one thing soooo goood.\nApostle Paul is like that highly specialized tool. God apointed him to a very specific job. To bring the Gospel to Gentiles. To me and you. So, we as non jewish believers should pay extra attention to what the Paul says. Because, God apointed him to be a messenger specifically to us.\nApplication. You might say like \u0026ldquo;yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s all good and all. But what is the practicality of this all? It is nice to know maybe even interesting but, how does it impacts my life\u0026rdquo;.\nI\u0026rsquo;m glad you asked because it is very important part. Typically we do not study the bible for the sake of it. We study the bible to help ourself to alighn with the will of God for us.\nRespect the authority of the bible And the first thing that we leared is that we should not doubd the authority of the scriptures. Regardless wether it is the words of Jesus, or any other apostile they all come from the same source. So, we shoud give up on our pride and submit to scriptures.\nDisregard of one\u0026rsquo;s will Second is that to be God\u0026rsquo;s servant is mean to disregard your own will for the will of God. If you want to serve the Lord you should give up control. Leave your plans and vision for your life and start praying and asking \u0026ldquo;God, what do You what from me?\u0026rdquo; And it is not easy thing to do.\nNotes\u0026hellip; For some time already we are talking about what it is to be a true fallower. As we studied the letter of John this topic would come up again and again. Some time in the past Matt preached to us that following Jesus is not the same as following someone on the social network. It\u0026rsquo;s not about reading statuses and reacting to posts. Giving your thumbs up and likes.\nFollowing Jesus means to live the kind of life he lived. Just like Paul: \u0026ldquo;Disregard your own will. And submit to God\u0026rsquo;s will for your life\u0026rdquo; 00:00:00 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/romans-introduction/","tags":null,"title":"Romans 1:1 17"},{"categories":null,"content":"Easter (1 Corinthians 15) 1 Corinthians 15:1,2 ¹Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand,²and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you — unless you believed in vain.\nToday apostol Paul reminds us of THE GOSPEL. Gospel that we\u0026rsquo;ve heard, and believe. At least most us did.\nGospel But you might wounder what is \u0026ldquo;GOSPEL\u0026rdquo;. Or maybe you don\u0026rsquo;t really think about it. Maybe you think that the Gospel is some sort of special term that used in the bible only. But, no. Gospel - in original language, simply means a \u0026ldquo;good news\u0026rdquo;. I can get a call from a friend who will tell me:\nLet me share a gospel with you. Tea is on special in the carefour. You can get two packs for the price of one.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a real gospel or good news for me. Because you, know who doesn\u0026rsquo;t like a good burgeon. There is nothing magical about this word.\nAnd so today we gonna be reminded about good news. Good news that most of us once heard, and believed. Good news that is very, very important and very relevant for us today. Something that we should hold fast to, otherwise all our believing, our entire fallowing in vain.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t want to, you know do the thing, commit my entire life to it, and then in the very end to realize that it was all for nothing. Do you? I don\u0026rsquo;t think so.\nIn our scripture for today Paul reminds us Gospel that come from above. He did not came up with this good news. He received it and then passed it on. And this domino effect reached us at some point. One day we\u0026rsquo;ve heard this, indeed good news, and believed. Good news that became, or at least it should have become a very foundation of our life. Gospel that give us hope. Gospel that give us boldness.\nGood news about something that is very very important. So let\u0026rsquo;s read very carefully.\n1 Corinthians 15:3,4 ³For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,⁴that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,\nOut of everything that good news about Jesus Christ contains. As of first importance or in other words THE MOST IMPORTANT PART that Paul wants us to know. Prat that serves as the very foundation for all our hopes in Christ. And probably the only reason that makes Gospel viable. Is that Jesus DIED in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures.\nWe already discussed few Sundays ago that, historical existence of Jesus Christ is well proven. And we can surly say that if we believe history at all, we have no reasons to doubt that the man Jesus Christ existed.\nBut just believing in existence of Jesus Christ DOES NOT give us much. If we hope to receive those blessings that bible promises, to those who will believe in Jesus. If we hope for reconciliation with God. We need to believe that Jesus not only DIED, but also that He was RAISED form the dead on the third day.\nDIED We know from historical records that Jesus Christ was crucified. This whole week we meditate and talk about it. He was crucified by roman authorities. And as people say, Romans did not invent crucifixion, but they did perfected it.\nIt was horrible, extremely painful way to execute people. I\u0026rsquo;m not gonna describe the whole process. In short the actual nailing to the cross was only a part of the whole chain of events that one was subjected to. And you can be sure, once someone got on the cross he not getting off alive.\nSo, when some people say, and some truly believe, that Jesus just fainted on the cross and not actually died, and then got back conscience in the tomb. Such a nonsense. Crucifixion was not the walk in the park. You can be sure that roman solders knew what they doing. They\u0026rsquo;ve had a lot of practice. We can be sure that Jesus died on the cross.\nIt is something that had to happen. It was part of the deal of being the messiah. He died instead of us. He drank that cup of the God\u0026rsquo;s raft instead of me an you. No one took the life of Jesus. He willingly put his life on the altar for our transgressions. In accordance with the Scriptures.\nRAISED But his death is not the end. It is only part of the story. Not only he had to die. But he also he was supposed to be RAISED from dead on the third day. As it was prophesied.\nDeath of Jesus, even though very tragic, doesn\u0026rsquo;t really change much without his resurrection. And the resurrection part is the one that is hard to believe. If you remember Paul in Athens. When he spoke in front of the brightest people of the time. They have listened to him. They was ready to accept the Gospel of Jesus Christ, until Paul spoke about resurrection. Then it all fell apart for them. That was something they could not comprehend.\nBut luckly for us, there were witnesses. Who saw Jesus after he rose again. And they are not few. At the moment Paul wrote his letter most of them were still alive. Let\u0026rsquo;s read:\n1 Corinthians 15:5-8 ⁵and that he appeared to Cephas(Peter), then to the twelve.⁶Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep.⁷Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.⁸Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me.\nThere were a loads of witnesses of the Jesus Christ who raised from the dead. Literally hundreds of people who could testify that they saw Jesus Christ Risen. You know, if you struggle to believe something. It helps were there is couple people say it is true. But it is even more helpful when there is few hundreds of people saw it is true. Five hundreds people met Jesus after he rose from death at one time.\nAnd this is the good news. This is the Gospel - that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead. This what give us hope. This is the reason for us to look forward into the future.\nNow I want to pose a question. I want you to think about it thoroughly. Because, as wired believes people church in Corinth had. And believe me they were very unique in this regards and had a lot of wired ideas. Nevertheless they believed in the resurrection of the Jesus Christ. Real resurrection. That not only spirit of Jesus rose from the dead but his body as well.\nBelieving in resurrection of Jesus was not their issue. I think majority of us do not struggle with it ether. The issue is a bit different. And I think if we will be honest we struggle with the same kind of issue. At least we tent to live our daily life like that. What is the Issue you may ask?\nISSUE 1 Corinthians 15:12-19 ¹²Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?¹³But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.¹⁴And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain.¹⁵We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified about God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised.¹⁶For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised.¹⁷And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins.¹⁸Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.¹⁹If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.\nIf in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are the most miserable people.\nIf we follow Christ to have some sort of trouble free life. If the scope of our hopes are for this life only. You know if we hope that God will deliver us from much troubles in our current life. We are to be pitied the most. It\u0026rsquo;s just does not have sense. Because, yes, following God comes with it\u0026rsquo;s benefits and blessings but it is also comes with the fare share of sorrows and troubles. And it very well may happen that not following Christ will result into more peaceful life, longer life.\nThink about Steven being stoned for his faith in Christ. His life would definitely be longer if he would not stick out. Think about about Paul and all suffering he had to go through again and again. Pretty much everywhere he go, people tried to kill him. How it is easier life? Think about all those who were tourchered and murdered for their faith in Christ. If there is no resurrection, if there is no life after this one, it\u0026rsquo;s just doesn\u0026rsquo;t make any sense.\nAll the conspiracies about disciples stilling the body of Jesus, and then proclaiming Him being raised from the dead do not make any sense, if you will consider how far followers of Jesus have been willing to take this believe. Docents and docents of people not just layed their lives. They have gone through horrible tourchers, was martyred for their faith. No one will ever do anything like that just for a joke. To have a last gag at everyone. There is no chance.\nPeter, Paul, Steven and many others believed that they will be raised from the dead. They believed in the life after this one. A real life. This life is only foreshadow of what is coming. And that faith enabled them to give up their current life. Because, why would you not? You don\u0026rsquo;t want a shadow of the car when you can have a car. You don\u0026rsquo;t want just a shadow of the house, when you can have a house. If there is life after this one then, their choice make sense. But then our choices often does not.\nQUESTION I wanna challenge you today. Do you really believe in life after this one? In resurrection of the dead? Do you really believe that YOU will be raised? Do you live as if you mean it? Or my hope in Christ is for this life only? Am I the most miserable person of all?\nREMEMBER:If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are the most miserable people.\nLet me today share a Gospel. The Good new with you. Open your heart and let is soak in:\n1 Corinthians 15:20-26 ²⁰But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.²¹For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.²²For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.²³But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ.²⁴Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power.²⁵For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.²⁶The last enemy to be destroyed is death.\nChris is Reason! He is the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. In other words he is the leader of those who will raise from the dead. He is not the only one, but simply the first one. First out of many.\nAccording to some sources the word firstfruits or \u0026ldquo;aparche\u0026rdquo; in Greek, in the daily life meant \u0026quot; the entrance fee\u0026quot;.\nYou know, when you go to a gym for example, you gotta pay an entrance fee. And only then you can come in. We are too broke to pay that fee. There is no way anyone can pay required amount. The price is too high. We just do not have that many resources.\nThe Gospel or the GOOD NEWS is that Jesus payed our entrance fee. And now we can enter into eternal life.\nBut friends, do not be confused. I wanna say something that perhaps you didn\u0026rsquo;t though about.\nEveryone is eternal. And everyone will be raised at the end of time. And all will get the new body.\nThose who believe in the Gospel of Jesus Christ will be raised into eternal life. They will receive new body that is capable and compatible with the new reality of the kingdom of God. Our body will change. As Paul states in verse 53:\n1 Corinthians 15:53 ⁵³For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality.\nIt still gonna be a body. But glorified body. Different, superior in all regards. Our current body is just a foreshadow or the new one. We don\u0026rsquo;t have time to cover all that Paul has to say about it in this chapter. Just as a little hint, a tether for those who wanna know more:\n1 Corinthians 15:35-38 ³⁵But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?”³⁶You foolish person(literally stupid)! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.³⁷And what you sow is not the body that is to be, but a bare kernel, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain.³⁸But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body.\nSo, we will be raised in the same fashion Jesus was raised from the dead. We\u0026rsquo;ll be given new body that is able to be a part of the new world.\nBut those who did not believe will be raised too. And perhaps they as well will receive the new body. But a different one. Unlike those who believe, they will raise into eternal punishment.\nMatthew 25:46 ⁴⁶And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”\n2 Thessalonians 1:9 ⁹They(those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus) will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might\nRevelation 20:15 ¹⁵And if anyone\u0026rsquo;s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.\nThose who do not believe will raise for eternal punishment. And they will be given bodies that are able to withstand eternal punishment. Eternal destruction. And it is not the place you wanna be. And it is not the place God wants people to be in. That lake of fire is not for the people. It is for the Satan and those who follow him.\nThe Gospel I preach to you today is CHRIST IS REASON. There is resurrection of the dead. You and I will be raised to a new life even if we die. We will get new, glorified body to live in Gods kingdom. That will be superior in all regards. Our current body is nothing but a seed.\nIf you follow Christ and do not believe in resurrection of the dead. Into life after this one. Or if you simply live as if it is not true. You are of all people most to be pitied.\nToday is the day to believe. Today we celebrate the resurrection of our lord Jesus Christ. He is our firstfruits, our entrance fee. Stop doubting and believe!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/easter-2025/","tags":null,"title":"Easter 2025"},{"categories":null,"content":"1 John 5:6-13 ⁶This is he who came by water and blood — Jesus Christ; not by the water only but by the water and the blood.

Last Sunday we stopped at the verse 6. We talked about what does it mean to be born of God. About importance of following his commandments. And at the end we talked about overcoming the world. And that the victory comes through our faith in Jesus Christ.\nThe name and the figure of Jesus Christ is crucially important. Without Him nothing make sense. Without Him there is no hope. No grace. No future. We want to be sure that Jesus from Natharet is the one. Because if he is not, we are in big trouble. Then we hope for nothing.\nSo, it is our topic for today. Is Jesus really the Christ? Let\u0026rsquo;s turn to 1 John 5 verse 6.\n1 John 5:6 ⁶This is he who came by water and blood — Jesus Christ; not by the water only but by the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the one who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.\nRight of the bat we get hit with a statement that rather confusing if you really think about it. To come by water and what? The blood? What does it mean? Does John speaks about literal water and the blood? Or maybe he speaks figuratively, maybe water and blood are the symbols? And if so, what are they symbolize?\nDisclaimer I must tell you that I\u0026rsquo;m not a big fan of the symbolical approach to scriptures in general. When people try to find secret meaning and interconnections everywhere in the bible, turning every scripture that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand or disagree with into some symbolical, metaphorical substance, which meaning can be twisted any way you like. Though there is place to some symbolism in some of the scriptures(especially in the old testament). For the most part bible actually means what it says. We need to learn to read, to understand and to believe the word of God. Instead of turn everything into a symbols and then fitting the word of God into our worldview.\nWith that being said. I hope it will not be too hypocritical of me to talk about some symbolism today.\nJesus the man To be completely honest with you, verse 6 is one of the more difficult verses to understanding and interpret. Throughout the church history there were a lot of theories of what the \u0026ldquo;water\u0026rdquo; and a \u0026ldquo;blood\u0026rdquo; means. People have debated this for a while. And even though we can\u0026rsquo;t say with a 100% accuracy what was on John\u0026rsquo;s mind when he have said that. We can rely on the context of the letter that will take us to the point. We can derive the meaning which will agree with the rest of the letter, new testament and the whole bible.\nIf we look at this verse in a literal sense. If John meant actual water and actual blood. Then we the \u0026ldquo;water\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;blood\u0026rdquo; testifies that Jesus was a real human being. Remember that Jesus of the Bible. Jesus Christ that we believe in, was 100% God, but also He was 100% Man. He \u0026ldquo;came by water and blood\u0026rdquo; which testify that he was truly born as a baby. I\u0026rsquo;ve witnessed birth of the baby. It was rather dramatic experience for me. I almost fainted at the very end, but nevertheless I can assure you the water and the blood is a part of the process.\nWhen the baby get\u0026rsquo;s born it does come to this world by water and blood.\nSome other people argue that John refers to that moment when Jesus was priced by a spear of a roman solder, there on the cross. When, as bible says, \u0026ldquo;the water and the blood came out at once(John 19:34).\u0026rdquo; Which proves the same point. That Jesus Christ was not any kind of spirit or a phantom. He was a man in the body just like me and you.\nAnd it makes sense when we consider that at the John\u0026rsquo;s time early church were challenged by a heretical teachings which by the way present to this day. Gnosticism demanded that Jesus was never a man. That such exalted spiritual being as God cannot have anything to do with such a low matter as human body. And therefore Jesus only appeared to be a man, but in reality He was a spirit. Throughout his letter John addresses this lie many times providing the evidence that Jesus in fact was a man of the flesh and blood. So, it would make sense for John to speak about literal, not symbolical water and blood. To disprove those lies.\nJesus understand us But it is also possible, maybe even more likely, that John, as he sometimes did, talks symbolically. And he doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean actual blood, and actual water. But rather refers to some important events that symbolized by water and the blood.\nAnd in the context of what John is talking about, the water would point out to the beginning of the ministry of Jesus. His baptism.\nWater John the Baptist came ahead of Jesus to prepare the way. He started to baptize people in water. Something that we still do to this day. When we get baptized in the water, we get baptized into forgiveness of our sins. We leave are old, sinful life and start new life with God. That is what John the Baptist was preaching. And many people came to him to get baptized.\nJesus also came to John to get baptized. But in case of Jesus, he had no sin to repent of. He was sinless. Why then He come to John for a baptism? In fact when Jesus came to get baptized, at first John refuses to baptize Him. John wanted to get baptized by Jesus.\nMatthew 3:14,15 ¹⁴ John would have prevented him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?”¹⁵But Jesus answered him, “Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he consented.\nWe not gonna dig into this situation. But clearly Jesus comes to John for a different reason. One of the very significant events that happened there, at the baptism. Is that Jesus get\u0026rsquo;s revealed to the public as a messiah. Only after baptism His ministry takes off. So, the water testifies that Jesus is the Messiah. We can consider baptism as some sort of the public announcement. Were God proclaimed, publicly - \u0026ldquo;This is my Son\u0026rdquo;.\nBlood As much water talks about THE BEGINNIG of the ministry of Jesus. The blood testifies about completion of his ministry. Because, if would read the prophesies about the messiah. And very soon we will do so, because Easter is around the corner. We would see that the ministry of the Christ was not only in the proclaiming God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom, healing and dong great miracles. But the most important part of true messiah was his DEATH.\nIsaiah 53:7-10 ⁷He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.⁸By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people?⁹And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth.\n¹⁰Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him; he has put him to grief\u0026hellip;\nThrough His death Jesus accomplished the great plan of God. He shed his blood, and died on the cross. Yes, he truly died in the most literal sense. The water and blood that came out of his side when he was pierced by the spear, bears medical testimony of the death of the body.\nHe death was NOT a failure, not a defeat. Death didn\u0026rsquo;t take him, because death had no power over him. He willingly gave his life. To take OUR place. Payed OUR debt. His blood testifies that he IS the messiah.\nHe not only started his mission. He successfully fulfilled EVERYTHING.\nAnd remember what happened when He died? Ground shook, rocks split. Day turned into night. The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.\n“When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed,‘Surely he was the Son of God!’”\nThink about it. Roman centurion, military person, and solders. Who was not of faint of heart. Got terrified. If you will talk to military people, veterans who\u0026rsquo;ve been through stuff. Typically they are not get scared easily.\nBut those guys were terrified. So much so they exclaimed \u0026ldquo;Surely he was the Son of God!\u0026rdquo;\nThe blood of Jesus testifies - He IS the one\n1 John 5:6 \u0026hellip;And the Spirit is the one who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.\nSpirit of God also testifies that Jesus IS the chosen one. We can read the testimony of the John the Baptist:\nJohn 1:32-34 ³²And John bore witness: “I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.³³I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’³⁴And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.”\nAlso, Jesus himself says that:\nJohn 15:26 ²⁶“But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me.\nSpirit of God that lives in our hearts testifies that Jesus is the one. You just know it to be true, and maybe you not even sure why you believe so. You don\u0026rsquo;t have any proves or reasons to believe, but you just know. It is because the Spirit of God, God\u0026rsquo;s seed that is in us bears witness about our Messiah.\n1 John 5:7,8 ⁷For there are three that testify:⁸the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree.\nThe Spirit, Water and Blood. Tells us the same thing. They all point to the fact that Jesus is THE Messiah. The only one. Son of Men AND the Son of God. Who was born by the virgin. Lived among us. He was one of us. And then he died for us. Not in some metaphorical sense. He went through tourcher and then He was crucified. He hang on that cross until his heart stopped beating. When they pierced his side with a spear, water and blood came out, which is a medical evidence of the heart rapture. His body died on that cross. But, then he rose again. God rose him from death.\nThis 3 testimonies agree. And therefore we can believe that it is true.\nYou know any time you have to deal with some legal issue. Which often involve witnesses. One witness it\u0026rsquo;s kinda not enough. Often you need to have at least two or three witnesses for the testimony to have legal power.\nFor example here in Georgia you can go to the public service hall and get married. Even as a foreigners. All you need is 2 witnesses, who will sign for you. And with that state gives you a document that have legal power. You are married officially, it is for real.\nIn our scripture we presented with 3 witnesses which testify that Jesus is The Christ, the messiah. And their testimony is legit. It is to be believed.\n1 John 5:9 ⁹ If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, for this is the testimony of God that he has borne concerning his Son.\nOften we have no problem to believe the testimony of men. When you get text from you fried that tell you \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t drive on Chavchavadze today. It is awful. You\u0026rsquo;ll get stuck for hours.\u0026rdquo; You believe that. You avoid that street even though, you didn\u0026rsquo;t see that traffic yourself. Especially if this information comes from more then one person. We believe it.\nAnd if we believe people which we do. We don\u0026rsquo;t have any excuse not to believe God. Because his testimony is inheritanle more reliable then the testimony of the man. People can lie to us, or they can be confused themselves. So, every time you believe someone you put great deal of trust, that this person actually knows what he is talking about.\nIn case of God. He cannot lie. He only speaks truth and He truly knows what he is talking about. He is an expert and we can trust his words.\nAnd what is the testimony that God gives? It is that Jesus IS the Messiah. The son of God. And therefore we should believe in Jesus. Not just agree with the fact. But believe fundamentally. This faith should become a very foundation for our living.\n1 John 5:10 ¹⁰Whoever believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. Whoever does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son.\nIf we do not believe in Jesus of the Bible. We call God a liar. Can you imagine yourself if from of allmighty God. Who created the universe just with his word. Imagine standing in front of such a great God calling him a liar. Not the position you want to be in. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to appose God. You\u0026rsquo;ll lose. You gonna hurt yourself.\nYou know sometimes my kids wanna wrestle with me. And sometimes I let them. I don\u0026rsquo;t fight back, often I don\u0026rsquo;t even try to resist. I just let them do their thing. I love them, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to hurt them. But, you know what often happens? They hurt themselves. I don\u0026rsquo;t have to do anything.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t want to be in apposition to the Father. He loves us. He wants us to be blessed. He did everything possible to help us out.\nIf our life is a test. Then he gave us the book, the manual. So we can learn and get it right. But also then he gave us cheat sheet to help us even more. But then, he could\u0026rsquo;t help himself and pointed to the right answer and said. \u0026ldquo;This is the right answer\u0026rdquo;.\nMost of us been through the exams. Some of our people regularly have to suffer through those tests and what not. And when you have teacher on your side who helps you our. You believe him.\nAs we live our life. As we taking that test. We have our great Teacher on our side. Who points to the right answer. Will you trust God? Will you believe what he says about his Son? Will you follow Jesus of the bible?\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/1-john-5-6-13/","tags":null,"title":"1 John 5 6 13"},{"categories":null,"content":"1 John 5:1-6 ¹ Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him.² By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments.³For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome.⁴For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world — our faith.⁵Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?\nIntroduction We continue to work our way though the Book of 1 John. We are basically at the finish line, chapter 5 is the final chapter. Couple more Sundays and that\u0026rsquo;s it. I hope you are not too tired of the book of John yet. In a way it might seem to be a bit repetitive. Again and again John comes back to the same topics, same concepts, same themes if you will.\nAnd sometimes we can dislike it. We can get annoyed. Because, we already heard it. How much we can talk about it after all? We want something new, something fresh. New revelation, a new knowledge, that what we are after.\nI have at least couple people in my life who not a big fans or hearing the same thing many times. If only I will dare to start telling them the same story, they will immediately go \u0026ldquo;yeah, you already told me that one\u0026rdquo;. And I get that. Typically we don\u0026rsquo;t like to hear same thing again and again. We get bored, we lose attention. We want to move on.\nAnd unfortunately often we treat the bible same way. And not only bible but any type of learning for that matter. How many times when you learn something. You watch someone doing a thing. Probably some sort of tutorial on the YouTube. And you think to yourself \u0026ldquo;ok, I get it. It\u0026rsquo;s not that hard\u0026rdquo;. And then you go and try it yourself. I did it many times. Very quickly you get to realize that you were wrong. You have only though that you understand. But, in reality, you don\u0026rsquo;t. And you have to go back and look at it again and again, and keep trying until it \u0026ldquo;clicks\u0026rdquo;. Until you have this \u0026ldquo;a ha\u0026rdquo; moment. \u0026ldquo;Now I actually understand.\u0026rdquo;\nEver happened to you?\nHappens to me all the time. So often that this days I already know. That I have to grind the basics until it \u0026ldquo;clicks\u0026rdquo;, then I\u0026rsquo;ll be ready for more advanced stuff.\nDrums example? When me and guys learn something on drums. We go though the song and start breaking it down. You know, what played where. Rhythms, drum fills. And no one ever whats to sit and do the boring part like \u0026ldquo;FIRST_VIDEO\u0026rdquo;. Painfully slow, possibly for hours on end. It is boring, it is not fun. You can probably do it first try. Why to bother. We all wanna do cool fancy stuff like \u0026ldquo;SECOND_VIDEO\u0026rdquo;.\nNone of us wanna do a basic boring thing. We all want cool, advanced stuff. But advanced cool stuff ONLY possible once you mastered boring basics. I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you more than that. Often cool stuff you see ARE the boring basics just speed up.\nNow, I\u0026rsquo;ll tell something that is almost universally true. Not only for learning musical instrument but for learning, or solving pretty much anything. And most definitely apply to our life with God.\nRepetitive practice of simple basics gives us ability to approach complex problems. When we study Gods word. Often times what we need is NOT special revelation, NOT a new knowledge. We need start practicing what we learned. Then and only then we will be able to move forward. We should practice those very basic, very boring things that we learned the first week being a Follower of Christ. We need to do same thing again and again until it \u0026ldquo;clicks\u0026rdquo; in our head and your heart. Until it becomes our second nature. Sometimes people call it \u0026ldquo;revelation\u0026rdquo;. Whatever you call it. That is the moment when the word written becomes a living word for you, for your life.\nSo buckle up and let\u0026rsquo;s get to it.\n1 John 5:1 ¹ Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God\u0026hellip;\nWe already talked a little bit about \u0026ldquo;been born of God\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;to be born again\u0026rdquo;. Remember Jesus and Nicodimus? Jesys: \u0026ldquo;You have to be born again to enter the kingdom of God!\u0026rdquo; Nicodimus(puzzled): \u0026ldquo;How can it be?\u0026rdquo;\nHere we are provided with an answer \u0026ldquo;in a nutshell\u0026rdquo;. You get born again by believing that Jesus is the Christ, the messiah, YOUR messiah. Not just a messiah, not just yet another one among the other viable options. He is the only one. Period.\nAnd it is not about just intellectual agreement. Like we would agree many thing, which has 0 impact on our life. How about: \u0026ldquo;did you know that Australia is “technically” wider than the Moon?\u0026rdquo; (PICTURE). Do you feel your life changed? Do you feel yourself a new person? Maybe it completely changes your life? Probably not.\nWhen we say \u0026ldquo;Everyone who believe\u0026rdquo; mean something more then just acknowledgment of the fact.\nJames 2:19 ¹⁹ You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe — and shudder!\nMire intellectually agreement not gonna help you much. All demons believe in the reality or the authority of Jesus, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make them \u0026ldquo;children of God\u0026rdquo;\nWe talking about believing that becomes very foundation for your life. Your actions, and decisions, your attitudes derive from this believe.\nWhy not to steal? No one will ever find out\u0026hellip; Why not to cheat when you know for sure you\u0026rsquo;ll get away with it? Why not just lie and avoid all the trouble? Why not to take advantage of this person? You\u0026rsquo;ll never get anywhere in life if you\u0026rsquo;ll always try to play fair\u0026hellip; Everybody does it.\nAnd so on\u0026hellip;\nWe all know the right answers to this questions while sitting comfortably in the church, among other believers. But in real life scenario when the choices we make not so painfully obvious. When the consequences and what is on the line is way more serious. When you on your own and need to make up your mind. Is it suddenly not all that easy. What is your foundation will get reveled.\nAlmost anyone can be a good person when life is going well and you are in the good mood. But When you go through a rough times, when you go through fire, that\u0026rsquo;s when it will get clear whether you \u0026ldquo;mastered the basics\u0026rdquo;.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve been born of God if you accept Jesus as YOUR Christ, YOUR Savior, YOUR Messiah. When this believe becomes your foundation. Impacts every sphere of your life. Gets into all nukes and crannies of your heart. 1 John 5:1 \u0026hellip;and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve been talking about this for weeks now. So, hopefully this truth starts to penetrate it\u0026rsquo;s way into our hearts and minds. Because it is very important to understand that:\nthe love for God and love for his children is inseparable Imagine one saying: \u0026ldquo;I love parenting. It is the best job in the world. Absolutely love it! Being the parent is such a blast.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd you like: \u0026ldquo;Hang on, but you don\u0026rsquo;t have kids, don\u0026rsquo;t you? You not even married\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThen the person is like \u0026ldquo;Yeah, kids. Honestly hate kids. It\u0026rsquo;s just not for me. You know, hole day long repeating the same things again and again. All this \u0026ldquo;being an example\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m not good at it. I\u0026rsquo;m a \u0026ldquo;single\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;parent\u0026rdquo;. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that a thing?\u0026rdquo;\nSounds silly isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nAs silly as it is. It can be just a slightly exaggerated version of us, claiming to love God, claiming to be born again, claiming to be a true followers. When in our hearts we do not love our brothers and sisters in Christ.\n1 John 4:20 ²⁰ If anyone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.\nThis scripture states that one cannot love God, if one failing to love the person next to him! Loving God and loving God\u0026rsquo;s children always go hand in hand.\nBut again, what is to love? Throughout the whole letter John makes it clear, that to love is not about the words or feelings. Those are good things, and they should be part of our expression of love. But they do not define whether we love. Last week we touched some practical aspects of loving God and his children.\n1 John 3:17 ¹⁷But if anyone has the world\u0026rsquo;s goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God\u0026rsquo;s love abide in him?\nWhen we participate in each other lives, Practically helping one another in our needs it indicates that God\u0026rsquo;s love abides in us. Or in other words, it shows our love for God. Naturally as people we tent to be selfish and egocentric. Look at kids, and you\u0026rsquo;ll see that that\u0026rsquo;s haw they typically behave. We have learn to care about others. We have to learn generosity. We have to practice them. Matering the basics. Naturally we think \u0026ldquo;me\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;for me\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;about me\u0026rdquo;. And when we see the need, financial need, often we turn away. Because it will take something from \u0026ldquo;ME\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ll not be able to get what \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; what. Therefore it is \u0026ldquo;NOT MY\u0026rdquo; problem.\nMore generalized way of looking at love presented in the verse 2\n1 John 5:2 ² By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments.\nIf you are still with me. You can spot a little something here. You might have a question on your mind.\n\u0026ldquo;Hang on, isn\u0026rsquo;t you just said that to love God is to love God\u0026rsquo;s children? And now you saying that loving God\u0026rsquo;s children is about loving God?\u0026rdquo;\nYeah, that is correct. If you think about it for a moment it makes perfect sense. There is no contradiction or confusion here. When we look into a next verse, we see that:\n1 John 5:3(a) ³For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments\u0026hellip;\nThis is the key to understand how it all works. We show our love for God, by keeping his commandments. And his commandments are about loving one another. So, we can say that keeping God\u0026rsquo;s commands is often about loving God\u0026rsquo;s children.\nGod is love. He want us to love one another. And doing this is the best way to show that we love God. That we care about what He is saying. That we care about his feelings and opinions. And if we read verse 3 to the end, it get\u0026rsquo;s even better.\n1 John 5:3(b) \u0026hellip;his commandments are not burdensome.\nJesus says in Matthew 11:30: \u0026ldquo;For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\u0026rdquo;. His commandments are not to hard to understand and follow. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to spend most of your life in seminaries to understand Jesus\u0026rsquo;s commandments. Anyone can comprehend what they mean. Most of them come down to????? You guessed, to love!\nIn religious system, with it\u0026rsquo;s over complicated set of rules and rituals, which often people don\u0026rsquo;t even understand. You feel like you have to do whole bunch just to keep God satisfied with you. And not get punished. Such life is burdensome. That was the state of affairs when Jesus were among us. He sharply criticized this system.\nHe came and explained God\u0026rsquo;s heart. He reveled the meaning of it all. And when we cant understand WHY and not only WHAT. When we understand that God\u0026rsquo;s commandments are keeping us safe and secure. That they are only for our benefit. Then we happily follow them. They are not burdensome anymore.\nSECURITY RULES It is somewhat like safety rules on job site. Everybody hate them, because they are often make your work harder and more cumbersome. So,people ignore them. And only do bare minimum when boss is around.\nBut then if anything happen they have to suffer. I remember when me and Matt were fixing a car. We bought a part off a junk yard. Because you couldn\u0026rsquo;t find it otherwise. And due to it being the second hand part, which was taken off the other vehicle it had some extra bolts and what not that we didn\u0026rsquo;t need. We had to take those off first.\nOne bolt was particularly stubborn and rusty and wouldn\u0026rsquo;t budge. But, you know, I knew how to deal with those. We needed a blowtorch. You know the little gas thingy. We didn\u0026rsquo;t have one(we are in the middle of the forest, so no shops around). But we had a gas torch for working on roofs, you know the big thing that attaches to a huge gas tank.\nWe fired that one up. Everything was looking good. You can hear the flame roaring. You feel this power, like a wizard who can control the flame. You are on the top of the world man with a tool!\nAnd then something exploded. To this day I have no idea what it was. But it was so loud you can\u0026rsquo;t even imagine. I was shocked. My ears ringing, I can\u0026rsquo;t hear anything. Blowtorch is on the ground. All your fight or flight mechanisms are maxing out. Adrenalin rushing through you, making it hard to think.\nMaking story short, ringing would not go away even after a month. I was afraid I damaged my hearing permanently. Had to go to the hospital(yes, only month later. You can tell I don\u0026rsquo;t like hospitals). And few weeks later, after some medication it was back to normal.\nI have quite a few similar stories. But this time I got really scared. I regretted not wearing ear\u0026amp;eye protection. I realized that they are not to annoy me, not to restrict or make my work harder then it should be. They are for MY good, to protect me.\nIn the same way God\u0026rsquo;s commandments. They are not the set of stupid, meaningless rules that you have to follow, in order to keep God happy. No, they are there to protect you. They are there to make sure you can live freely and happily. That you do not hurt yourself and others. God gave us those rules, commandments, only because he cares for us. Because he loves us soooooo much!\nYes it is not always easy. We still live in the broken world. And remember that this world opposes God, and everyone who belongs to Him. Otherwise we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t ever sin. Our battle is not over yet. But we have hope, which is:\n1 John 5:4,5 ⁴For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world — our faith.⁵Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?\nWe are on the winning side! When we put our faith in Jesus Christ, then we are winners. Jesus says:\nJohn 16:33 ³ In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.”\nHidden truth, secret knowledge that they don\u0026rsquo;t want you to know is that - we overcome the world by putting our faith in Jesus Christ! Victory doesn\u0026rsquo;t come from us. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t depend on our abilities, agility, strength, endurance. None of that. Not by what we do, but though our faith in Jesus Christ, the Son of God. HE have overcome the world.\nConclusion Overcoming the world is a complex problem. Life in this broken world can be complicated. Sometimes is is hard to love people around us. Especially those who get on our nerves. Sometimes things look impossible. But let\u0026rsquo;s remember, that it is not a super revelation that enables us to overcome this world. Not great spiritual power. Not some sort of the hidden, secret knowledge. But practicing simple, boring, everyday principles of God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom:\nTrust your life into God\u0026rsquo;s hands(born again) Love God - follow his commandments Love God\u0026rsquo;s children - practically, let your love be real. Do not rely on your abilities - rely on your faith in Jesus Christ 00:00:00 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/1-john-5-1-6/","tags":null,"title":"1 John 5:1-6"},{"categories":null,"content":"Last Sunday we started our conversation about the reality of spiritual world. We discussed how modern notion of science vs spirit influences us to disbelieve into the reality of a spiritual realm. We uncovered that actually science and spirit are not in opposition to each other. And believing in the reality of the spiritual world does not mean the rejection of science, return to a stone age, tribal life in caves and hunting mammoths with handcrafted spears. We learned that the world doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to believe in reality of the spirit because:\nJohn 4:24 ²⁴God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”\nIf we believe in God and if we want to worship him in a true way, we have to accept the reality of the spiritual world. We also have to accept that our enemy is real too. One who work against all people in general and against us, as followers of Christ in particular. More specifically we learned that it is not only the Spirit of God that can manifest to us, but there is also spirit of antichrist or spirit of error, as John calls it later.\nWe talked about the danger of \u0026ldquo;false prophets\u0026rdquo; and how to tell whether the word you hear is from God or not.\n1 John 4:4-6 ⁴Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.⁵ They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world, and the world listens to them.⁶We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error.\nVerse 4 says that there is a confrontation of two worlds. There are those who are form God, and those who are from the world. \u0026ldquo;The world\u0026rdquo; battle against those who are from God. Remember, not so long ago we discussed that the world that John refers to, is not people, or nature, but ungodly, system, lifestyle that was inspired and crafted by the enemy. We do not fight against people, even though often, not to say always, Satan uses them to bring us troubles.\nPaul writes in Ephesians 6:12:\nEphesians 6:12 ¹²For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.\nThis is our real enemy, not people. God \u0026ldquo;desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth(1 Timothy 2:4).\u0026rdquo; Let\u0026rsquo;s remember that.\n\u0026hellip;you are from God and have overcome them(verse 4)\nYes, there is a confrontation, the battle. But we should not be troubled. Because the winner is already known. Those of God, are on the winning side. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you never gonna have any problems. Otherwise, it is more probable that your dedication in following Christ will get you in trouble. You will get rejected by this world. You will have issues, and I\u0026rsquo;m not talking about those that caused by our own foolishness. But, rather confrontation that we experience because of our faith, our believes. This worldly system resist God, and anyone who comes from him is not welcomed.\nBut he who is in us is greater then he, who is in the world.\nNo matter what this world throws at us. No matter how hard the enemy tries to suppress us, we can have confidence. Not because of our own strength. Not because enemy is powerless, not at all he have all kinds of power and resources. He manages to keep a lot of people in state of fear and terror. Do not be deceived, our enemy is a real enemy. But our God is greater. We should not fear this world and satan because, the one who is in us is greater then the one who is in the world.\nOpposition God desires all people to be saved and know the truth. But the enemy desires otherwise. Satan hates God. He want\u0026rsquo;s to hurt God as much as possible. He can\u0026rsquo;t do it directly, it is not withing his power. So, instead. Enemy targets God\u0026rsquo;s most loved creation the people. Enemy tries to make people, to ignore, disobey and hate God. Showing God, \u0026ldquo;Look, they love me, they chose me, they follow me\u0026rdquo;. He tries to deceive as many people as possible and cause them to die. Not just physically, but eternally. To be forever separated from Creator.\nPeople of this world don\u0026rsquo;t bother enemy too much. They already under his control. But those who are not of his kingdom is completely different story. Satan fights against us, trying to trick and lead astray. Twisting the truth, as he did from the beginning.\nSometimes enemy comes as a friend, promising things you desire.\nDid God really said that you should not date unbelievers? You\u0026rsquo;re gonna be fine, it only matters whether he/she is a good person\u0026hellip; You will never meet another one like she.\nIs it really a lie if you just don\u0026rsquo;t mention problems your car has? You never gonna sell it if you tell everything\u0026hellip; Think about it. You need as much as you can get.\nIs it really necessary to go to church every week? You need rest, once or twice a month is totally fine. It is not like you have to\u0026hellip;\nListen to this guy. He such an amazing speaker. Yeah, he is atheist, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a big deal. It is only religion, it\u0026rsquo;s doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matters.\nBut his only intention is to make you turn away from God and die.\nOther times he tries to scare you, to put you in a state of constant worry and fear. And one of the best ways to do that, is to assure you that God is angry with you. Using his false prophets and false prophesies he creates a fake image of God. And makes you to believe in it.\nBack in the day, when mobile phones were just taking off. First iPhones just started to get imported and sold where I lived. Many people heard about them, that they are good phones, wanted to try them out. They also saw the images. But hardly anyone actually held them in their hands. And you know what, there were a ton of scammy companies who sold low quality replicas that looked like the real thing on the first glance, but of course was not iPhone by any stretch of imagination. But people bought them, thinking it a legit one.\nSo, companies who sold real iPhones. Would write articles on how to spot fake. How to avoid scam. What to look for. What are the differences are. Because, unless you know how that phone feels, you\u0026rsquo;re not going be able to spot a fake.\nIn the same way a lot of people promote fake salvation, fake Jesus, fake faith. Or all together attempt to convince you that it all doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, and you can replace faith with philosophy. People on the internet talk about good, moral concepts. Some of them even pretend to be Christians. They avoid any scriptures that would be problematic for the people in the modern world. And they are listened to, they are fallowed, acknowledged. Millions upon millions listen to them. Do you what to know the key to their success?\n1 John 4:5,6 ⁵ They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world, and the world listens to them.⁶We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error.\nthey are from the world, they speak from the world =\u0026gt; world listens to them\u0026hellip;(verse 5)\nPeople of this world doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to submit their way of thinking to God\u0026rsquo;s truth. They will happily accept the fake of the enemy which perfectly fit\u0026rsquo;s their worldview.\n1 John 4:6 ⁶We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error.\nWho John refers to when he says \u0026ldquo;WE\u0026rdquo;? Of course he talks about himself, but also Peter, Mark, Matthew, Luke, Paul, and about all those who follow true Jesus. Those who holds on to the original good news, that they received. Those who let God to transform their mind with a new way of thinking. Instead of twisting the bible to fit their worldview.\nIf you didn\u0026rsquo;t submit your life, your heart and your mind to God. If you don\u0026rsquo;t care, if you do not agree with bible. If the word of God is not your ultimate source of truth. Your life is under the power of the spirit of error. And in the end, it is gonna take you places you do not want to be in.\n1 John 4:7-12 ⁷Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God.⁸ Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.⁹In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him.¹⁰In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.¹¹Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.¹² No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.\nThere is a lot in this scriptures. We probably will come back to some of it later. But today I want us to notice the pattern that John follows in his letter. Every time he touches specific topic, giving a word of warning, and/or providing directions and instructions, then comes back to love. You know why? Because love is probably single most important principle. Pretty much the whole entire bible can be summarized to love. No one ever seen God, but one thing we know about Him is that He is love. And we can be sure that we are in God if his love abides in us.\nJesus says:\nJohn 13:35 ³⁵ By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”\nWe, as followers of Chris, not gonna be known by the power that we have. Not by the great music we play. Not by the way we look, or language we talk. But by our love for one another. We are called to love one another in a very radical way, we are called to mimic the way God loved us. Our love should be very real, very practical.\n1 John 4:13-19 ¹³ By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.¹⁴And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world.¹⁵ Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.¹⁶So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.¹⁷By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so also are we in this world.¹⁸There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected in love.¹⁹ We love because he first loved us.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a great summary of everything we\u0026rsquo;ve been talking about for last two weeks.\nGod gave us His spirit. God\u0026rsquo;s seed abides in us, because we have been born of God. God sent his Son into the world. Jesus came as a 100% human and 100% God. This is a true Jesus we believe and follow. And anyone who teaches otherwise doesn\u0026rsquo;t have truth in him. We believe that God loves us. That He is for us, he is on our side. He did everything that was required and even more to save us from eternal death. We know that we were born of God if His love abides in us. And love of God gives us confidence for the day of judgment, because we follow and reflect God in this world. God doesn\u0026rsquo;t operate though fear. If your life under control of fear and worry, they do not come from God. You need to stop believing lies of the enemy and come to the truth. We don\u0026rsquo;t have to do anything to earn God love. God loved us first. He loved us while we were still sinners, while we still ignored and hated Him. We need to humble ourselves and accept that God loves as we are. And once we born again and his love, his seed starts to abide in us, we get transformed. God is love and God loves this people. He is still on our side, always will be. So, if you find yourself today constantly troubled, restless, depressed. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;ve been exposed to the \u0026ldquo;false\u0026rdquo; prophets, and that word put you in the state of confusion and worry. Or maybe you never actually repent before God. Maybe you never experienced that transformation of being born again. Come, and we will pray. We will pray for love of God to cast out all fear. We will pray for God\u0026rsquo;s peace.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/1-john-4-4-19/","tags":null,"title":"1 John 4:4-19"},{"categories":null,"content":"Spirit of Truth vs Spirit of Error Intro Our scripture for toady is 1 John chapter 4. And we gonna talk about some things that are not very popular. We gonna talk about spiritual realm a little bit.\nScience that replaces the Spirit In today\u0026rsquo;s world many people do not even believe in the reality of the spiritual world. We\u0026rsquo;ve been taught in our schools that in the old days, when people were less knowledgeable and more superstitious. They could not explain why certain things happened, so they came up with idea of unseen power and believe in gods and spirits. But in our day we have science that can explain everything. We do not believe that old stuff anymore. Moreover if you believe in reality of spiritual world, you might be treated as a fool, as ignorant wiredaw. We are taught that only fools believe that.\nWe are effected by no spirit mentality And because we were taught this way, we tend to skip or overlook biblical scriptures which talk about spiritual realm. We treat them as if they were written for the people of the past. Because those people weren\u0026rsquo;t particularly smart, so they needed some sort of explanations, which they would be able to comprehend. And so we, modern, educated people mark those scriptures as irrelevant and outdated, and move on. Often we don\u0026rsquo;t even think twice about it, we skip ahead almost subconsciously.\nIt is very arrogant and altogether the wrong approach. Spiritual world is very real. Always been. Science and Spirit is not in opposition to each other.But our enemy doesn\u0026rsquo;t want us to believe that. One might think of why it is the case?\nJohn 4:24 ²⁴God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”\nReality of spiritual realm God is spirit, and if spiritual realm does not exist, then God does not exist either. But also, it\u0026rsquo;s a great disguise for the enemy himself. He works against us. And if we reject the very existence of the realm where he operates, it makes his job so much easier. Friends, spiritual world as real today as it were in the day when Jesus waked this earth. And we need to be aware of this. Denying spiritual world makes us vulnerable. It is like denying viruses. Viruses do not care weather you believe in them or not, you still gonna get affected, you still gonna get sick. Also, by denying spiritual world we essentially denying existence of God.\nSo, before we will proceed to our scriptures for today, first we have to make an agreement. Which is that we, as followers of Christ, believe in spiritual world.\n1 John 4:1-4 ¹Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.²By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,³and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist , which you heard was coming and now is in the world already.\nEarly church believed in spiritual world Existence of spiritual world was not even an issue for the early church. It was a regular part of life. But it\u0026rsquo;s not particularly true for us today. I\u0026rsquo;m not gonna speculate on why. One thing that comes to my mind is that potential cause is our unbelief. We make ourselves deaf and blind to the spiritual realm, because we don\u0026rsquo;t want to see. With that being said, we still might experience an encounter with the spiritual world. And when that happens: when for example we saw a vision, or someone had a word of prophesy for us. Maybe word of knowledge, and etc. There are a lot of \u0026ldquo;options\u0026rdquo;. We get so excited. That we don\u0026rsquo;t even bother asking questions. We forget that it is not only God\u0026rsquo;s spirit, that can interact with us.\n\u0026hellip;do not believe every spirit (verse 1)\nNot every inspiration that comes to us is of Gods spirit. Not every person who claims that God speaks to him, who claims to be, or act as a \u0026ldquo;prophet\u0026rdquo;, is actually of God. Not every person who claims to have a divine knowledge, claims to be used by God, is actually of God. We SHOULD assess whether they are from God or not.\n\u0026hellip;many false prophets have gone out into the world\nThe term \u0026ldquo;prophet\u0026rdquo; is not a very commonly used word anymore, in a minute we will look into what that\u0026rsquo;s mean. But again, If you sitting here thinking it is no longer relevant it belongs to the past. It is not. All this things are true to this day. If nothing else it is more relevant today, because we are so much closer to the end of time, then those who read this letter first.\nWho is prophet? So, who is a \u0026ldquo;prophet\u0026rdquo;?\nGenerally speaking the prophet in Greek writings, is an interpreter of oracles or of other hidden things. The one who speaks by divine inspiration. There were all kinds of people who claimed to be prophets. In our case we can narrow this term to a context of a christian community. So, Prophets that appeared in the apostolic age among Christians are:\nPeople in the assemblies of the Christians, who were moved by the Holy Spirit to speak, having power to instruct, comfort, encourage, rebuke, convict, and stimulate believers.\nThe blessing and the danger of the prophets Gift of prophecy is a beautiful gift, and very helpful for building up the church. Gift of the spirit are real and very, very good and very helpful. Bible says that we SHOULD DESIRE spiritual gifts, especially prophesy.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a great gift for the church to have. Very useful and very powerful. It can help us a ton in our christian journey. But it can also be extremely destructive if we will allow a wrong person to speak into our lives. False prophet can do a great deal of damage to the christian community. Cause all kinds of problems, cause the church to split and etc. There are examples of this. Therefore before we allow the person to speak into our life on behalf of God, before we accept the word that has been spoken, we need to assert weather it actually comes from God.\nSpirit of truth vs spirit of error How can do we make those assertions? Well, there are few things that might help. There are scriptures that helps with that. In our passage for today we are provided with a very reliable approach.\n1 John 4:2,3 ²By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,³and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s break it down.\nTo know the Spirit of God ²By this you know the Spirit of God\u0026hellip;\nOur the most reliable protection layer against false anything is to know the Spirit of God. Maybe you never though of this, but when we receive Holy Spirit, we all receive the same Spirit. Same Spirit dwells in my heart and your heart, not just same kind of spirit, no. One Spirit, abides in you and in me, at the same time.\nWater system illustration I\u0026rsquo;ll try to give you an illustration. My analogy not the most accurate, but still I think it might help us to understand, at least partially, how that works. When you receive the Holy Spirit it\u0026rsquo;s like getting connected to a water system. When I open my tap at home I get the same water I would get if I would open tap here, at the church. Same water runs in old city, at Orby Towers, at the airport and etc. All our water comes from the same source. When you open your heart for the Holy Spirit, It moves in you as well as in all others who opened their hearts to God. All who is off God, united in and by His spirit.\nSpirit of God works outside of time. Spirit that inspired John to speak and write his letters 2000 years ago, inspired me to speak to you today. Same Spirit inspiring people all over the globe. We all take from the same source. And this source never changes.\nSo by learning how to recognize the Spirit of God we will be empowered to make an assessments of things we sea and hear.\nTrue Jesus \u0026hellip;every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,³and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God.\nI want to pay attention at the verb confesses. In Greek it is homologeō which means:\nto say the same thing as another, i.e. to agree with, assent\nIf we would re-read this part again it would sound like Every spirit that agrees with that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God. Why John is so specific about that? It is clearly not ultimate comprehensive assessments. There are plenty of those who agrees that Jesus \u0026ldquo;came in flesh\u0026rdquo;, as human. But, they are most definitely not off God. What\u0026rsquo;s up with that.\nContext is important It will all get cleared in the second. As soon as we will take into account time and situation in which John writes his letter. This is very important when you study, or just read the bible. You cannot ignore the context, otherwise it will lead you into heresy.\nToday is different For us today it is not hard to believe in Jesus the man. Historical existence of Jesus is proven. And for vast majority of people is not hard to believe that at some point in the past there were a really good man Jesus. Who was a phenomenal spokesman and impacted the society in a very dramatic way.\nToday\u0026rsquo;s problem For people of our day it is hard to believe in his divine nature. As we mentioned in the beginning a lot of people reject the very existence of spiritual world. Therefore it is hard for them to believe that there is God, and that God became man.\nIssue of the day of John But in the day of John it was almost opposite. For a lot of people it was not too hard to believe that Jesus was God. There were plenty witnesses of his miracles still around. People saw with their very eyes the impossible done by Jesus. But for some people it was hard to believe that he was actually a man. That he had actual body. Those people would say that he was a phantom. That we appeared to have flesh, but it was only illusion.\nThey will try to fit Gospel in their world For some people especially with a Greek background it was hard to believe that God can become a man. For them two were incompatible. It went against their view of the world. And instead of submitting, accepting God\u0026rsquo;s truth, they\u0026rsquo;ve tried to fit Jesus into their worldview. This lie started to spread among people. It was easier for some to believe, because it would align with their way of thinking. This false teaching started to creep into churches. It was a big problem. That\u0026rsquo;s why John address this issue very specifically. That\u0026rsquo;s why he says \u0026ldquo;any spirit, to deny Jesus the man is not to be trusted\u0026rdquo;\nTrue Jesus Big underlying issue is when we try to fit bible into our view of the world. When we try to modify what we read about God, Jesus, Holy Spirit to assent with OUR way of thinking.\nWe loose the image of TRUE Jesus. There are communities of such sort, we do not call them churches, because they are not. We have them here in Batumi. Who do not believe TRUE Jesus. Who have their own version. We have individuals who come to our church. Who do not follow same Jesus we follow. They have their own image. Image they created after their own heart.\nThe truth is not in such person. Any such person cannot speak on behalf of God.\nProphesy will agree with God\u0026rsquo;s word Spirit of God will confess, which means - will say the same thing as and agree with Jesus Christ. God is not going to contradict his own word. Whatever revelation, enlightenment, vision or prophesy you\u0026rsquo;ll receive personally or though other people, it should ALWAYS 100% agree with the word of God.\nAny person who claims to speak on God\u0026rsquo;s behalf, anyone who claims the authority to speak into your life should be assayed. Any such person should confess TRUE JESUS. Should submit to Gods word. And not the other way around.\nConclusion Friends, spiritual realm is real. If you discard spiritual world, you cannot worship God in a true fashion, because He is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in the spirit. We should not close our eyes on all things spiritual. But, we also should be careful with what we accept. We should be careful with the things people say on behalf of God. Online, and in person. Especially when someone comes to you with \u0026ldquo;a word from God\u0026rdquo; for you. It is up to you to assess this word according to the bible. And also assay any \u0026ldquo;prophet\u0026rdquo;. Because many false prophets are out in the world.\n00:00:00 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/1-john-4-1-6/","tags":null,"title":"1 John 4 1 6"},{"categories":null,"content":"Born of God To be born of God. This is not how God Calls us Most of us without a doubt will call ourselves \u0026ldquo;Christians\u0026rdquo;. We so used to this name. It is so dear to us and we are so attached to it, that many people almost believe that maybe even Jesus Christ himself secretly started to call his disciples Christians. And it\u0026rsquo;s not a bed name don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong. That\u0026rsquo;s not what I\u0026rsquo;m saying. What I want to say is simply that this is NOT how God calls us.\nOrigin of the name Depending on the context sometimes, it is not all that important. But sometimes the difference is crucial. First of all it was not even disciples or followers who invented the term \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;Christians\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo;. If we would to look into acts 11:25-26. We would see WHEN and WHERE this name takes it\u0026rsquo;s origin:\nActs 11:25,26 ²⁵So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,²⁶and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a great many people. And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians.\nIt was other people who started to call followers of Christ \u0026ldquo;Christians\u0026rdquo;. It started off as a nickname. Like a collective description of the group of people with the same interests. Today we call some groups like Rednecks, Nerds, Christians\u0026hellip;\nTerm \u0026ldquo;Christians\u0026rdquo; in the modern days In the modern day a lot of people consider themselves Christians for a variety of different reasons. In countries with a strong cultural bond, like Georgia. People often say something among the lines: \u0026ldquo;My parents were Christians, and grandparents were Christians, therefore I\u0026rsquo;m a Christians\u0026rdquo;. In minds of many to be Georgian is to be Christian. It\u0026rsquo;s not exclusive to Georgia, there are other nations like that. Because, Christianity in their mind is a part of their cultural heritage. It\u0026rsquo;s a tradition. Just a title. Often it has very little to do with the faith and lifestyle.\nAll together, it is not very reliable term this days. This world called us Christians. But, God gave us the other name. There is a biblical concept that does way better job in defining who is who.And that is To be born of God.\nBorn of God. Introduction Jesus introduced the idea that you should be born again. Born from the spirit. When he talked to Nicodemus. Who was the teacher of the law and one of his(Jesus\u0026rsquo;s) secret followers.\nJohn 3:3,5 ”³Jesus answered him(Nicodemus), “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.”⁴Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother\u0026rsquo;s womb and be born?”⁵Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God\n1 John elaborates on this In his letter John repeats and elaborates on this. He says: \u0026ldquo;we are God\u0026rsquo;s Children NOW\u0026rdquo; In the verse 1. We already talked about it a little bit last Sunday. God loved us so much, that he not only took away our sin. But he also, made us a part of His family. How great is that? In the verse 9 we get a bit more explanation. We can see more connection with what Jesus were saying to Nicodemus:\n1 John 3:9 ⁹ No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God\u0026rsquo;s seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God.\nToday I want us to pay closer attention to this two statements:\nHe(the person) Has been born of God God\u0026rsquo;s seed abides in him(person) This two statements are very important. We not gonna be able to cover their meaning in full today. There is not enough nether time, nor the knowledge, that I poses. But, nevertheless we will shed some light on it.\nNot yet transformed, but already children In verse 2 John saying that we already are Children of God.\n1 John 3:2 ²Beloved, we are God\u0026rsquo;s children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is.\nWe still to undergo some major transformation. We will receive new glorified body, like one Jesus have. There are few places in the new testament which talk about this. I can share a list with you if you want to read more about it. As for now we will briefly read one scripture to give you an idea if you have never heard of it yet.\nPhilippians 3:20,21 ²⁰But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,²¹who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.\nIt is an interesting topic but it is outside of our scope for tonight. The main point that I want to emphasize is that, despite that we are still in our old bodies, which suffer from diseases \u0026amp; fleshly desires we ALREADY ARE children of God. When we come to God. When we confess our sins. When we !GENUINELY repent and accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior. We receive Holy Spirit and we get BORN AGAIN - experience radical transformation in our relationship with God. We become children of God.\nForeigners in this world When we get born again, we die for this world. We become foreigners. Verse 1 says that this world does not know us. That\u0026rsquo;s because when we die(figuratively speaking) for this wold, we broke that intimate bond, that deep relational connection with the worldly system. It cannot recognize us anymore. We start to belong to a different kingdom. And we cannot be a part of both.\nThere is a key difference that separates us, makes us incompatible with this worldly system. We change our citizenship, change our status. We get reborn and God\u0026rsquo;s seed abides in us now.\nUnderstanding seed It is very important to truly understand what that mean. This word SEED is an interesting word. Widely used in agriculture and biology. Seed is something that produces new life. Produces offspring.\nSame type of species As you know I\u0026rsquo;m not too much into agriculture and biology. But one thing that I know it that seeds always produce same type of species. You can\u0026rsquo;t grow banana trees from apple seeds. Mountain lions don\u0026rsquo;t give birth to monkeys. And the same among the humans. We are very much like our parents. Weather we like it or not, when we conceived we inevitably inherit some core characteristics of our parents. Their seed abides in us.\nI tried to be not like my dad My childhood was not a \u0026ldquo;bed of roses\u0026rdquo;. In my teenage age i decided that I don\u0026rsquo;t want to have anything to do with my dad. And I would meticulously get rid of any similarities, weather it is a way of talking, some behavioral patterns, anything that I could spot. And you know what? I didn\u0026rsquo;t succeed very much. I thought I did, but I was wrong. Once I got old enough I realized that unconsciously I\u0026rsquo;m actually a lot like my father. Because, his seed is in me. There is no way around it.\nSpiritual rebirth When we get born of God. We experience this rebirth in our spirit. It\u0026rsquo;s not just words. It\u0026rsquo;s a fact that we accept by faith. You might not feel anything physically at first. But it shows through. This radical change in our relation to God cannot go unseen. There will be some noticeable changes.\n1 John 3:4-9 ⁴Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.⁵You know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.⁶No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him.⁷Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.⁸ Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.⁹ No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God\u0026rsquo;s seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God.\nAttitude to sin. Lawlessness First noticeable difference is that our attitude to sin changes. In verse 4 we read that sin is lawlessness, and to practice sin is to practice lawlessness. Let\u0026rsquo;s break this down:\nTo practice lawlessness means to regularly or intentionally engage in actions that disregard or violate laws, rules, or norms. It implies a consistent habit or behavior of acting without respect for the authority.\nIn other words it means that those who are sinning disregard God\u0026rsquo;s law, and therefore disregard God, the one who created the law.\nTo disregard someone - means to ignore them, treat them as unimportant, or show a lack of consideration or respect for them. It involves not acknowledging their feelings, opinions, or presence.\nLove vs Disregard. Make practice of sinning You don\u0026rsquo;t treat anyone you love in this fashion. Maybe we can even argue that love and disregard are opposite to each other. And this is perfect description of how people of this world live their lives. They do not consider God. His feelings, opinions or presence. They make practice of sinning and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t bother them a bit.\nWe were just like that. Once we were just like that. We loved to sin. We were proud of our sins. Maybe we would even compete with our friend who would take it further. We made plans to sin. We would reflect on our past sins with a great satisfaction. We used to find great pleasure and comfort in our sins.\nThis is regular state of mind, state of heart of someone who is, as John says, of the devil. If you love sin, then devil is your father.\n1 John 3:8 ⁸ Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.\nHabitual sin vs occasional Again, I will repeat myself and say that we are not talking about occasional sin. We all sin time to time. And John addresses it in the very beginning of his letter.\n1 John 1:8 ⁸ If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\nNo, in out today\u0026rsquo;s passage we talk about people who love to sin. Who is not bothered by it. Who chose sin as their lifestyle. Who finds pleasure, enjoys their sins and plan to continue. As verse 8 says people who make a practice of sinning or as the other translation says who love to sin. Such people are of the devil. That\u0026rsquo;s the people of this worldly system. They are not of God. Any such person never seen or knew God according to the Bible.\n1 John 3:9 ⁹ No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God\u0026rsquo;s seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God.\nWe inherit from God When we born of God. Once His seed start to abide in us. We become new creatures. We inherit our father\u0026rsquo;s characteristics. And since he hates sin. We start to hate sin too. It is not about our will power or something. No, it becomes our nature.\nMe and Ales For example I like to rules. Let\u0026rsquo;s say we are playing a board game. I really dislike when people break the rules. It bothers me a lot. Also, I have a son(more then one actually). And you know what? My son, big surprise, is just as much into rules as I am, in not more. How much will power, of effort it took him to become like his father? Maybe he spent years training himself to like rules? No, he just inherit it from his parents. My seed abides in him\nSummery So, as John says\n1 John 3:7 ⁷Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.\n1 John 3:3 ³And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.\n1 John 3:9 ⁹ No one born of God makes a practice of sinning\u0026hellip;\n1 John 3:10 ¹⁰By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother.\nChildren of God In his letter to the church. On one hand John explains who are the true Children of God. Again and again he repeats and expands our view. Like a ripple on the water. We start at the core, and step by step expand our understanding.\nDeceivers On the other had he warns us about deceivers. False brothers who will try to lead us away from the truth. They can be still inside our church, in our mids, but also outside. Especially in our days of fast internet and countless hours of sermons and teachings available online. The goal of deceivers is to make you go astray. Be very very, extremely careful of what you listen too, because sure there are a lot of good material our there. But there is a lot of a false teaching as well. The most dangerous kind, which sounds alright for the most part. But as they say, the devil is in the details.\nLair The devil is ultimate lair. He perfected his art of deceiving. He will do what it takes to make you doubt God. Make you doubt yourself. To make you loose the joy of your salvation.\nDo not let devil to deceive you. If we adhere to this 4 principles:\nWe Don\u0026rsquo;t love sin We Love our brothers We Practice righteousness We Purify ourselves Then you can be sure that God\u0026rsquo;s seed abides in you. You\u0026rsquo;ve been born of God. YOU ARE the child of God who was born from death to life.\nPrayer If you unsure if ever experienced this radical Transformation in our relationship with God. If you still don\u0026rsquo;t find this 4 principles to be part of your life yet, but you want to change. You can come up to me after the service and we will pray together.(Or any other prayer that you need)\nTo be born of God: To have God\u0026rsquo;s seed =\u0026gt; to be like father. Righteous Sinless Pure Loving To have hope to be transformed. (Glorified body?) Pass From Death To Life Love Brothers Practically. Not by word but by work. Lay down your life Destroy the work of the Devil To be like Able Destroy work of satan? Children of God vs Children of the Devil Purifies himself Have God\u0026rsquo;s seed Purify themselves Do not sin* Love brothers Passed from death to life Transformation scriptures 1 Corinthians 15:42-44 Philippians 3:20-21 Romans 8:18-23 Matthew 13:43 Luke 20:35-36 1 John 3:2 2 Corinthians 5:1-5 Revelation 21:4 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/1-john-3-10-17/","tags":null,"title":"1 John 3:10-17"},{"categories":null,"content":"Initial Scripture 1 John 2:28,29 ²⁸And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he appears we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at his coming. ²⁹If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who practices righteousness has been born of him.\n1 John 3:1-10 ¹See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. ²Beloved, we are God\u0026rsquo;s children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. ³And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.\n⁴Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. ⁵You know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. ⁶No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. ⁷Little children, let no one deceive you.

He reminds us about the time of his coming.\n1 John 2:28 ²⁸And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he appears we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at his coming.\nThe context for this verse is right about it. Last Sunday we gave a good look at those verses. Where John warns against false brothers \u0026amp; Antichrists. Those who once was in the fellowship, but rejected Jesus and left the church. John tells us that not all who once \u0026ldquo;knew Jesus\u0026rdquo; will have confidence at his coming. As followers of Jesus Christ, we should anticipate His coming and rejoice about Him. But, some people not gonna be happy at all. We not talking about those who do not know Christ, the unbelievers. No, in this particular scripture we talk only about those who was a part of the church and left due to some wrong believes.\nJohn writes about those who, not only fell for a false believes, but also were trying to deceive people in the church. Reality is that all kinds of false, pseudo Christ teachings exist out there. From the beginning enemy tries to deceive people by twisting Gods word, by whispering into peoples minds. And as we said last week some people more prone to that. They can\u0026rsquo;t comprehend how simple the Gospel is. They are looking for something move advanced. And event though Bible has the depth, that we yet to uncover, in the pursue of the sacred knowledge, people OFTEN get off track. Others, get overwhelmed with their own pride, and believe that THEY have been trusted with a NEW revelation. That angels or probably God himself reveled that secret truth to them. Then Bible gets discarded as legacy and outdated source. And people start to move \u0026ldquo;by spirit\u0026rdquo;. Every cult, sect, or a false teaching started in a very similar fashion.\nGW probably are in the park right at this moment. Recently we\u0026rsquo;ve had some Mormon visitors in our church. And over the years serving to this very fellowship we\u0026rsquo;ve heard all kinds of wired and plainly non biblical theologies from people who came to church on weekly bases. I mean this stuff is real to this day. Even when people are not a part of a particular false teaching stream. They can still live in delusion about their false believes.\nLike a person who is slowly loosing the eyesight. Often they genuinely believe that their vision is good. For example my oldest son. He argued with me when I took him to get his vision checked. He were claiming that his vision is very much perfect. He was getting angry that we(parents) do not agree. But then, when he actually got the glasses. When he looked though them for the first time. He was amazed. He were been looking around, standing in the awe of the beauty of the world around him. He got back something he didn\u0026rsquo;t know he lost. Because vision goes down slowly, gradually. So smoothly that you don\u0026rsquo;t even notice that you see less and less. For us, his parents, it was somewhat obvious that our son don\u0026rsquo;t see as good as we do. But him, in that moment he was convinced that WE are wrong, and he is wright. He knows what he is talking about. He knows the truth.\nSame can happen to us. We can start loosing our spiritual vision. Slowly, gradually. It would get worse and worse, and we can fall for some lies that exist out there. Without realizing it. We would think that WE are right, WE clearly see the path. When in reality we already almost blind, and wondering in the darkness. That\u0026rsquo;s why it is important to stay connected. To belong to a church, to a fellowship of believers. To have people who can speak into your life, people that you will actually listen too. We have many people who are temporally stay here in Batumi. Who came here for a short time and then the go further. But, even in this circumstances you SHOULD belong. If not a permanent part of any church. You are in big danger. If this is you, you should reconsider your attitude, because it\u0026rsquo;s not a God\u0026rsquo;s will. And most likely pride starts to take over.\nWrong ideas \u0026amp; theologies, false teachings had always been around. Trying to snick into your heart and soul. It is like an infection, like a parasite that can kill you. But John gives us an ultimate cure. Natural remedy that will take care of all our spiritual inflammations. Abide in Him. As simple as that.\nAbide to have confidence and not shirk from him in shame when he comes.\nJesus is coming back Jesus is coming back. Bible is clear that this day will come and we not gonna know when it will happen. There is no way to know when you will meet the Lord. Jesus says:\nMatthew 25:13,14 ¹³ Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why it is important to be always ready. So that you can have confidence. Like a good kid, who does what he should and obey his parent. He is not concerned about when parents are coming home. He is confident, he knows that he not gonna get in trouble.\nTo be completely honest, I was not always like that as the kid. Me and my friends did all kinds of stupid things while our parents wasn\u0026rsquo;t home. Things I knew I\u0026rsquo;m not allowed to do. And I can tell you, I WAS very concerned and very worried about my parents coming back home early.\nNow, we are children of God, who happened to be \u0026ldquo;home alone\u0026rdquo; so to speak. And we are waiting for our Master to come back. And how we gonna feel at his return is up to us. For example at the end of his life apostle Paul says:\n2 Timothy 4:7,8 ⁷ I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. ⁸Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing.\nPaul had confidence that he not only will be with the Lord, but also, that God will be very pleased with him. Not only he kept the faith, but he also fought a good fight, finished the race.\nUnfortunately not all of us will be like apostle Paul. It is very possible for a person to start his journey well, and drift away later. We can see examples of this from the beginning. In the garden of Eden. Adam and Eve knew God. Once they had fellowship with Him and had no fear. But then, when they broke his word their attitude have changed:\nGenesis 3:8-13 \u0026hellip;⁸And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God\u0026hellip;\nThey had no confidence. They were afraid. They were not exited about the Lord\u0026rsquo;s coming. Like a naughty kids, they were ashamed and frightened. They suddenly realized that they didn\u0026rsquo;t do what they were supposed to. The same will be on the day when Jesus will come back. Some people, who once followed Him, will be ashamed. They will shirk from him in shame.\nBut it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be this way. It is up to us how we gonna meet the Lord, because God already did everything possible on His side of things.\nChildren Of God 1 John 3:1-3 ¹See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him.²Beloved, we are God\u0026rsquo;s children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is.³And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.\nOur Heavenly Father went above and beyond in his mission to save us from our sins. Not only our penalty got nullified, but also we were privileged to become children of God. He merged us into His family. And it is not just a promise of something that will happen in the future. No, it was already done.\nIn Jesus we find something greater then just a reset to the default settings. You know whey your device get\u0026rsquo;s really messed up. Nothing working and seems like there is no way to fix it. There is a last resort. Reset to default settings. It will cancel out all the changes that led your device to a poor condition.\nSometime we look at work of Jesus from the same perspective. That when Jesus died on the cross, he did a \u0026ldquo;global reset\u0026rdquo;. And now we are back to a \u0026ldquo;Garden of Eden\u0026rdquo; settings. But it is not exactly true. Adam was never part of God\u0026rsquo;s family. But through Jesus, God makes us his children. Not just servants or slaves, but children. It is unbelievable privilege. I think many of us hear this words so often that we kinda don\u0026rsquo;t hear them anymore. You know, when you hear something many, many times at some point it just turns into a white noise. Something on the background that you don\u0026rsquo;t even think about.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s think about this for a moment. It\u0026rsquo;s not just a nickname or a label. No, it is our new status. It is totally different kind of relationship.\nWhen we come to God. When we get born again, born of the spirit. We get born as God\u0026rsquo;s children. John says that we are God\u0026rsquo;s children now. We still in our old body. We still wrestle with our old sinful desires somewhat. But, we already are God\u0026rsquo;s children. We die for this worldly system. And born again to be children of God.\nWe find confirmation to this in that \u0026ldquo;the world doesn\u0026rsquo;t know us\u0026rdquo; anymore.\n\u0026hellip;The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. John says.\nI want us to have a closer look at the verb TO KNOW. It get used very often. Especially lately when we talk about knowing God. Or about world knowing us. I think we don\u0026rsquo;t perceive this word the same way it used in the Greek.\nIn original text γινώσκω (ginṓskō) - means \u0026ldquo;to know\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;to recognize\u0026rdquo;. But in opposition to a modern view of this word. In Greek it often goes beyond simple intellectual knowledge. It typically implies a deeper, more intimate understanding, experience, or relationship. In biblical context, ginṓskō often points to a type of knowing that involves relationship, intimacy, and understanding on a deeper, experiential level.\nWorldly system doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand us, doesn\u0026rsquo;t love us. Because, it does not understand and does not love God. Once we become God\u0026rsquo;s children we quit been children of this world. We become foreigners. We break this intimate connection with world. We die to this world. And we born again for God.\n\u0026mdash; CUT \u0026mdash;\n1 John 3:4-10 ⁴Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. ⁵You know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. ⁶No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. ⁷Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous. ⁸ Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. ⁹ No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God\u0026rsquo;s seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God. ¹⁰By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother.\nThere is a lot to unpack in this chunk. We will omit some of the thing for now, to make sure we stay focused. When we get born again God\u0026rsquo;s seed start to abide in us. It will relentlessly cause changes in us. Because all species are reflection of their parents. You can\u0026rsquo;t grow banana trees out of apple seeds. Apple seed produce apple trees. African babies, do not get born in let\u0026rsquo;s say Korian families, if they do, it raises a lot of questions. We all bear seed of our parents.\nWe know that there is no sin in God. That Jesus came to take away sins. So, the one who is born of God do not make practice of sin. We make practice of righteousness instead. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you will not ever sin again. We are not yet perfect, so we will fail. But you do not choose sin as a lifestyle. You do not plan on sinning. You do not \u0026ldquo;make practice\u0026rdquo; of sin.\nThis is how we know who is of God and who is of the devil. Sin - is the seed of the evil one. John says he was sinning form the beginning. So, therefore whoever make practice of sin is the son of the devil. Such person is the reflection of his father.\nThis world and people of this world try to confuse us with their clever talk. With their wisdom. Which often might sound resalable. But as John says don\u0026rsquo;t let anyone to confuse you:\nWe have the message we received from the beginning. Gospel of Jesus Christ. Today we are blessed to have a written word of God. And it is sufficient. If anyone says - Gospel is not enough to get saved - they are deceived. Same as those who say you do not need Gospel, or Jesus. There are a lot of liers out there who will tell you:\n\u0026ldquo;If have a decease, you are not born again because\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If you are not rich you are not born again because\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Christianity is ok but you are not real believer until you do X\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;etc\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nJohn says:\n\u0026ldquo;abide in his word and you will have confidence\u0026rdquo;\neveryone who practices righteousness has been born of him.\neveryone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure\neveryone practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.\nWe will have confidence on the day of his coming if we are born again. When we get born again we die for this world and become a babies in God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom. We carry God\u0026rsquo;s seed in us, and that makes us more like our father. And who is our father get evident by what we do. Children of God abide in his word and do his works. Children of devil abide in his word and do his works.\nLook at your life. If you live a lifestyle of sin. You need to get born again. As Jesus says:\nJohn 3:5-6 ”⁵Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.⁶ That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.\nIf you live a lifestyle of obedience to the God\u0026rsquo;s word. If you hate sin, and love your brothers. You are on the right track. You can have confidence. And it is important to preserve this confidence till the end. So that we can be like apostle Paul and others. And for that we need one another. For that reason God build his church.\n00:00:00 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/1-john-2-28-3-10/","tags":null,"title":"1 John 2:28-3:10"},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/manifest.json","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.de/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.es/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.fr/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.hi/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.jp/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.nl/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.pl/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.ru/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.zh-cn/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"Inductive Bible Study Method (Calvary Chapel Style) The Inductive Bible Study Method involves three main steps:\n🟥 1. Observation — What does the text say? Focus: Careful examination of the passage without interpretation.\nKey Tasks:\nRead the passage carefully and repeatedly. Identify: Who is involved? What is happening? Where is it taking place? When is it happening? How is it described? Look for: Keywords and repeated phrases Commands, promises, contrasts, comparisons Cause-and-effect relationships Literary structure Question to ask:\nWhat is the plain and obvious meaning of the text?\n🟧 2. Interpretation — What does the text mean? Focus: Understanding the intended meaning in its original context.\nKey Principles:\nContext is king — interpret within: The verse The paragraph The chapter The book The whole Bible Scripture interprets Scripture — use cross-references. Consider: The author’s intent The audience’s situation Historical and cultural background Word meanings in the original language (Greek/Hebrew) Question to ask:\nWhat was God saying to the original audience?\n🟩 3. Application — What does the text mean for me? Focus: Responding to the truth with obedience and transformation.\nKey Reflections:\nIs there a command to obey? A sin to avoid or confess? A promise to claim? An example to follow or avoid? A truth about God to believe or worship? A step of faith to take? Question to ask:\nHow should this truth change my thinking, actions, or heart?\n✝️ Calvary Chapel Emphasis Verse-by-verse expositional teaching Letting the Bible speak for itself Avoiding over-spiritualizing or allegorizing Dependence on the Holy Spirit for interpretation Goal: Transformation, not just information \u0026ldquo;Simply teach the Word simply.\u0026rdquo; — Calvary Chapel motto\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cheetsheet/","tags":null,"title":"Inductive Bible Study Method"}]
