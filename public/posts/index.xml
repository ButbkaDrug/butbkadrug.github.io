      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-scripture&#34;&gt;Initial Scripture&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-john-22829&#34;&gt;1 John 2:28,29&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;²⁸And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he appears we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at his coming. ²⁹If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who practices righteousness has been born of him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-john-31-10&#34;&gt;1 John 3:1-10&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;¹See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. ²Beloved, we are God&amp;rsquo;s children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears  we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. ³And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
