### 1 John 5:1-13
 ¹ Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him.² By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments.³For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome.⁴For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world — our faith.⁵Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?

 ⁶This is he who came by water and blood — Jesus Christ; not by the water only but by the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the one who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.⁷For there are three that testify:⁸the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree.⁹ If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, for this is the testimony of God that he has borne concerning his Son.¹⁰Whoever believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. Whoever does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son.¹¹And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.¹² Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.

 ¹³I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life.

Book of John is in a way repetitive. Again and again John comes back to the same topics, same concepts, same themes if you will. And we can dislike it. We can get annoyed. Because, we already heard it, we want something new, something fresh. New revelation, a new knowledge, that what we need.

I have couple people in my life that if only I will dare to tell them the same thing twice, they will immediately go "yeah, you already said that". Typically we don't like to hear same thing again and again. We get bored, we lose attention. We want to move on.

But despite all of that it might be something that we actually need. How many time you learned something. You watch someone doing a thing. And you think to yourself "ok, I get it. It's not that hard". And then you go and try it yourself, and very quickly you get to realize that it was that you only though that you understand. But, in reality, you don't. And you have to go back and look at it again and again, and keep trying until it "clicks". You have this "a ha" moment. "Now I actually understand."

### Drums example?
When me and boys learn drums. We go though the song and start breaking it down. You know, what played where. And it all seems clear as day, but then when we try to do it without the backing track or tutorial video. You get stuck immediately. You go back and revisit what you already heard and saw. Times and times again until it "clicks". And they you think "It was there from the beginning, how come i didn't understand that?"


Same thing happens when we study Gods word. Often times we DO NOT need a special revelation, we DO NOT need a new knowledge. We need start practicing what we learned and then and only then we will know whether we truly understand. And truth is that we probably don't. And then we should go back and read and practice the same thing again and again until it "clicks" in our head. Sometimes people call it "revelation". Whatever you call it. That is the moment when the word written becomes a living word for you, for your life. 


So buckle up and let's get to it.

>### 1 John 5:1
>¹ Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God...

 We already talked a little bit about "been born of God" or "to be born again". Remember Jesus and Nicodimus? 
 Jesys: "You have to be born again to enter the kingdom of God!"
 Nicodimus(puzzled): "How can it be?"

Here we are provided with an answer "in a nutshell". You get born again by believing that Jesus is the Christ, the messiah, YOUR messiah. Not just a messiah, not just yet another one among the other viable option. He is the only one. Period. 

You not just intellectually agree with this fact. Like we do about many thing, which has 0 impact on our life. 

### James 2:19
¹⁹ You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe — and shudder!

Mire intellectually agreement not gonna help you much. Demons do not argue reality or authority of Jesus, but it doesn't make them "children of God"

We talking about kind of believing that becomes very foundation for your life. Your actions, and decisions, your attitudes derived from this believe.

Why not to steal? No one will ever find out...
Why not to cheat when you know for sure you'll get away with it?
Why not just lie and avoid all the trouble?
Why not to take advantage of this person? You'll never get anywhere in life if you'll always try to play fair... Everybody does it.


We all know the right answers while sitting comfortably in the church, among other believers. But in real life situation when the choices you make not so painfully obvious. When the consequences and what is on the line is way more serious. When you on your own. Is it suddenly not that easy. Then what is your foundation will get reveled. Almost anyone can be a good person when life is going well and you are in the good mood. But When you go through a *rough times*, when you go through *fire* that's when it will get reveled what is your foundation.

#### You've been born of God if you accept Jesus as your Christ, Savior, Messiah. When this believe becomes your foundation. Impacts every sphere of your life. Gets into all nukes and crannies of your heart.


>### 1 John 5:1
>...and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him.


We've been talking about this for weeks at this point. So, hopefully this truth starts to penetrate it's way into our hearts and mind.

#### the love for God and love for his children is inseparable

Imagine one saying: "I love parenting. It is the best job in the world. Absolutely love it! Being the parent is such a blast."

And you like: "Hang on, but you don't have kids, don't you? You not even married..."

Then the person is like "Yeah, kids. Honestly hate kids. It's just not for me. You know, hole day long repeating the same things again and again. All this "being an example" I'm not good at it. I'm a "single" "parent". Isn't that a thing?"

Sounds silly isn't it? 

As silly as it is. It can be just a slightly exaggerated version of us, claiming to love God, when we do not love our brothers and sisters in Christ.

>### 1 John 4:20
>²⁰ If anyone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.

This scripture states that one cannot love God, if one failing to love the person next to him! Soon we will see that this two always go together. Loving God and loving God's children.

But again, what is to love? Throughout the whole letter John makes it clear, that to love is not about the words or feelings. Those are good things, and they should be part of our expression of love. But they are not define whether we love or not. Last week we talked about some practical aspects loving God and his children.

>### 1 John 3:17
>¹⁷But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him?

When we participate in each other lives. Practically helping one another in our needs, then it is becomes very good indicator that God's love abide in us. Or in other words, it indicates that we love God. Our natural reaction as people is to be selfish and egocentric. If you look at kids, that's haw they are typically. We have learn to care about others. We have to learn generosity. We have to practice it. Naturally we think "me", "for me" and "about me". And when we see the need, financial need, often we turn away. Because it will take something from "ME". I'll not be able to get what "I" what. Therefore it is "NOT MY" problem. 

More generalized way of looking at love presented in the verse 2

>### 1 John 5:2
>² By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments.

If you are still with me. You can spot a little something here. You might have a question on your mind. 

"Hang on, isn't you just said that to love God is to love God's children? And now you saying that loving God's children is about loving God?"

Yeah, that is correct. If you think about it for a moment it makes perfect sense. There is no contradiction or confusion here. When we look into a next verse, we see that: 

>### 1 John 5:3(a)
>³For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments...

This is the key to understand how it all works. We show our love for God, by keeping his commandments. And his commandments are about loving one another. So, we can say that keeping God's commands is often about loving God's children.

God is love. He want us to love one another. And doing this is the best way to show that we love God. That we care about what He is saying. That we care about his feelings and opinions. And if we read verse 3 to the end, it get's even better.

>### 1 John 5:3(b)
>...his commandments are not burdensome.

Jesus himself says in Matthew 11:30: "For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.". His commandments are not to hard to understand and follow. You don't have to spend most of your life in seminaries to understand Jesus's commandments. Anyone can comprehend what they mean. Most of them come down to????? You guessed, to love!

In religious system, with it's over complicated set of rules and rituals, which often people don't even understand. You feel like you have to do whole bunch just to keep God satisfied with you. And not get punished. Such life is burdensome. That was the state of affairs when Jesus were among us. He sharply criticized this system.

He came and explained God's heart. He reveled the meaning of it all. And when we realize why and not only what. When you understand that God's commandments are keeping us safe and secure, that they only benefit us. Then they are happy to follow them. They are not burdensome anymore.

It is somewhat like safety rules on job site. Everybody hate them, because they are often makes your work harder and more cumbersome. So,people ignore them. And only do bare minimum when boss is watching. And then they suffer. I remember when me and Matt were fixing a car. We bought a part of a junk yard because you couldn't find it otherwise. And because it was second hand part, that was taken off the other vihacle it had some extra bolts and what not that we didn't need. We had to take those off first.

One which was really rusty and wouldn't budge. But, you know, I knew how to deal with those. We needed a blowtorch. You know the little gas thingy. We didn't have one(we are in the middle of the forest, so no shops around). But we had a gas torch for working on roofs, you know the big thing that attaches to a huge gas tank.

We fired that thing up. Everything was looking good for some amount of time, and then something exploded. To this day I have no idea what it was. But it was so loud you can't imagine. My ears was ringing, I couldn't hear anything. Making story short, ringing would not go away even after a month. I was afraid I damaged my hearing permanently. Had to go to the hospital(yes, only month later. I don't like hospitals). And after some treatment it was back to normal.

I have quite a few of those stories. This time I got really scared. I regretted not wearing ear&eye protection. I realized that it is for MY benefit and not to make my life more complicated. 

In the same way God's commandments. They are not set of stupid, meaningless rules that you have to follow to keep God happy. No, they are there to protect you. They are there to make sure you live freely and happily. That you do not hurt yourself and others. God only cares because he loves us soooooo much!

Yes it is not always easy. We still live in the broken world. And remember that this world opposes God, and everyone who belongs to Him. 

### 1 John 5:4,5
⁴For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world — our faith.⁵Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?


We are on the winning side! When we put our faith in Jesus Christ, then we are winners. Jesus says:

### John 16:33
³ In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.”

Hidden truth, secret knowledge that they don't want you to know is that - we overcome the world by putting our faith in Jesus Christ! This victory doesn't come from us. Doesn't depend on our abilities, agility, strength, endurance. None of that. Our faith in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, makes us winners. Because HE overcome the world.



<!--WARN: CONCLUSION -->

Big thing is a small thing. 

Doing the small thing again and again giving you ability to do the big thing.

No one wanna do the small thing, because it's boring and whatever. Everyone wanna do the big thing!
