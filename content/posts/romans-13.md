### Intro
<!--TODO: write an intro -->


### Opposition
We live in the world where two kingdoms oppose each other. Kingdom of this world or worldly system, opposes God and His kingdom. This opposition is real. And unfortunately for me and you, we don't get the stay neutral. You can't say "I take no sides". It's not an option.

### Syco story
I have previously mention that I grew up in a small town. It's a nice place surrounded by forest. You cannot really tell now. But, back in the day, original idea was to build a town in such a way that if you look from above, all building would form a word. **USSR**. But then, soviet union fell and those plans came to an end. Leaving us only with USS but no R.

When I was growing up our town still preserved a bit of that nostalgic, post soviet, slightly depressing atmosphere. Especially in the Autumn. Grey sky, grey buildings, grey roads, grey everything. In the Autemn it get's dark pretty early. And even during the day you are not gonna see too much sun. So, even a daylight is kinda grey.

On the one of such day. At the evening. When sun was long gone. And darkness swollen the streets me and my friend were walking around. Talking about life. We were teenagers. I guess that's why night time was so attractive. Half of the street lights were broken, the other half was pretty dim and very yellow. Creating this post apocalyptic vibe. Most of the people were inside, enjoin their evening, getting ready for bad. Because, our town is not like Batumi. You have to get up very early to go to work. And that's why there are almost no people on the streets after dark. 

So, me and my boddy going down the empty street. Talking about some teenage stuff. We can see some guys from school a bit furthur away. We know some of them well, less so some other ounces. But anyway we should go and say hello to them.

We came closer. Shake hands. Start chatting. And as we having a small talk I look around. It's dark, it's quite. I'm slightly cold. Yellow light above the building entrance about 20 miters away trying it's best to light up the night. Not achieving very much to be honest. Some guy walking home by himself. Puffed up jacket makes him look like MMA fighter.

I'm kinda wondering in my thought. Thinking that dim light makes him look huge. And somewhere at the back of my mind I hear one of the boys saying:

- Hey, that's Syco.

Everything that fallowed have happened very quickly. Fractions of the second.

First I thought to myself "Syco"? I've heard about syco from boys. They were telling that they teething a guy. And he gets very mad very quckly. When he gets really mad, he chases them. And they run away. It is dump thing to do, that's what I always though. But, I imagined that they talk about harmless, maybe slightly odd, elderly man. But this guy... Man... This guys look like a killing machine! You would not want to mess around with him.

As I'm thinking that someone from our crowd shouts:
- Hey Syco, we're here!!!

My heart stopped. At that very moment, the guy — a beast of a man, a total unit — turned around and charged at us without a word.

All the other guys broke into a run — they were ready, they knew what was coming. They’d done this many times before. But me? I froze. Blacked out for a split second.

First thought to reach my mind, was the confident version of me saying: "Don't run. You are not with them. You did nothing wrong therefore you are safe".

Then reason kicked in with a counter-argument: "You think he cares? He's not about talk — he’s about violence."

That argument was strong enough. I ran. As fast as I could... The guy was fast, scary fast. But hey, I didn’t need to outrun him. Just the slowest guy in our crowd.

### No choise
And you know today. We can judge yang Viktar. Maybe we can say he could do better. He shuldn't have been there in the first place. And probobly that is true.

But that night I didn't get to chose. I was pulled into a struggle against my will. It did not metter that I don't want to be part of this. That I was there by acident. That I'm sorry. The guy would choew me up and spit me out. Before I would even say a word.

I could not escape the situation. I had to decide what I'm going to do...

### This world
Why am I telling you this story? Because so often, life is the same way. We get pulled into struggles against our will. We wish things like that would never happen to us. I know how that feels — I’ve had my own battles, and I know some of yours. They’re real. We wish things were different.

But, that's not an option. We can't control that. But we can control how do we go about it! We can utilize the wisdom of this wold. And worship this worldly system. Or we can use God's wisdom. And glorify Him in the choices we make.

Unfortunately, it's not all that easy. Often times you not gonna be understood. You not gonna be supported and accepted by the people of this world. If you will rely on God's wisdom. Often His wisdom looks foolish, counter intuitive, and sometimes offensive to the people of this world. They expect you to act just like them. And they get very upset and sometimes very angry if you don't. 

Even you, who is in the church right now. You can get angry and upset, and disagree with God's wisdom. You don't believe. Let's read our scripture for today than!


### Romans 13:1-14
> ¹Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God.²Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.³For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval,⁴for he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer.⁵Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake of conscience.⁶For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing.⁷ Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.

> ⁸ Owe no one anything, except to love each other...

How about now? I think that that's a tough scripture. I'm afraid I might actually get cancelled tonight. Because for many of us, one of the major reasons why we are here in Batumi, is our governing authorities.

Georgia going through a rough times right now. But even as non Georgian citizens we can relate to the situation quite well. I think all of Eastern European countries went through similar processes very recently. And when this kind of situations rise up, it is no brainier what the world expect from you. - **REBEL**

### Rebel
Rebel became our standard reaction. When we disagree. When we have enough of it. When we want something we don't have, but as we think we deserve. We rebel. In the garden of Eden, Adam and Even rebelled against God. But first Satan rebelled against God. Rebel - is his invention. It is his way.

Our scripture for today is opposite to rebel. It has a few bold statements that rob us the wrong way.

> "there is no authority except from God..."

> "whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed..."

> "that authorities are God's servants..."

Paul, are you out of your mind?

### Paul
Paul experienced fare amount of persecution from authorities. Roman government was not a fan of Christians by any stretch of the imagination. And yet, Paul by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit still writes this lines. "be in subjection"... "pay taxes"... Simply be a good citizen in all regards.

This is what God wants from you! Do this as an act of, obedience to God. Act of worship.

### Law breakers
God instituted authorities. They have function and responsibility before God. To serve people. To Protect them from wrongdoers. Punish the crime and etc. But even if they do not fulfill their function well. It does not make it fair for us to break the law.

We should not be the law breakers. God wants us to follow the laws of the country we're in. With an asterisk.

Which is that we believe in superiority of **Gods law**. If state forces us to break the low of God, we should not do that. We should follow the law of God first.

### Exodus 1:15–21
* Pharaoh commanded the Hebrew midwives to kill all newborn Hebrew boys.
* The midwives disobeyed the king’s order because they feared God more than man.

> ### Exodus 1:17
> ¹⁷But the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but let the male children live.

As a result God blessed them for their obedience to His law rather than Pharaoh’s decree.

* Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
* Daniel
* Mordecai
* John the Baptist
* Peter and the Apostles

All faced this challenge. 

As much as possible we should obey both. State law and God's commands. But in those rare cases when they contradict one another we should follow the law of God.

### GOD BLESSES OBEDIENCE
**Rebel is not God's way**. Obedience is. God does not want us to suffer unnecessary persecution. God wants us to be free. Free to do His will. Free to work for His kingdom. Free to serve the lost. To take care of poor. Orphans, widows. Spread the Gospel.

God bless obedience for His sake!

Our obedience does not mean that all authorities are good. That we agree with all they do. No. It does't justify their bad conduct. We should be in subjection not because governing authorities are great, but because we love God.

It is the act of worship.

Sometimes I forgive - as an act of worship. Because I love God.
Sometimes I keep my mouth shut. And don't reply to rudeness - as an act of worship. Because I love God.
Same with subjection to authorities. I do that - as an act of worship. Because I love God.

So, today I want you to consider. How well you adhere to this scripture. Do you subject? Do you pay taxes? Do you render everything that is due?

It doesn't mean that we should close our eyes and not to see injustice. No. But our place is not on the street fist fighting the police. Our battle is not against flesh and blood, but against the spiritual forces of evil. Our weapon is not a steel rod and broken beer bottle, but the prayer and love. 

Love your enemy.
Bless your enemy.

Live your life as an act of worship to the Lord.
