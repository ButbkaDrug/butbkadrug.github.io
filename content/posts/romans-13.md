### Intro
<!--TODO: write an intro -->


### Opposition
We live in the world where two kingdoms oppose each other. Kingdom of this world or worldly system, opposes God and His kingdom. This opposition is real. And unfortunately for me and you, we don't get the stay neutral. You can't say "I take no sides". It's not an option.

### Syco story
I have previously mention that I grew up in a small town. It's a nice place surrounded by forest. You cannot really tell now. But, back in the day, original idea was to build a town in such a way that if you look from above, all building would form a word. **USSR**. But then, soviet union fell and those plans came to an end. Leaving us only with USS but no R.

When I was growing up our town still preserved a bit of that nostalgic, post soviet, slightly depressing atmosphere. Especially in the Autumn. Grey sky, grey buildings, grey roads, grey everything. In the Autemn it get's dark pretty early. And even during the day you are not gonna see too much sun. So, even a daylight is kinda grey.

On the one of such day. At the evening. When sun was long gone. And darkness swollen the streets me and my friend were walking around. Talking about life. We were teenagers. I guess that's why night time was so attractive. Half of the street lights were broken, the other half was pretty dim and very yellow. Creating this post apocalyptic vibe. Most of the people were inside, enjoin their evening, getting ready for bad. Because, our town is not like Batumi. You have to get up very early to go to work. And that's why there are almost no people on the streets after dark. 

So, me and my boddy going down the empty street. Talking about some teenage stuff. We can see some guys from school a bit furthur away. We know some of them well, less so some other ounces. But anyway we should go and say hello to them.

We came closer. Shake hands. Start chatting. And as we having a small talk I look around. It's dark, it's quite. I'm slightly cold. Yellow light above the building entrance about 20 miters away trying it's best to light up the night. Not achieving very much to be honest. Some guy walking home by himself. Puffed up jacket makes him look like MMA fighter.

I'm kinda wondering in my thought. Thinking that dim light makes him look huge. And somewhere at the back of my mind I hear one of the boys saying:

- Hey, that's Syco.

Everything that fallowed have happened very quickly. Fractions of the second.

First I thought to myself "Syco"? I've heard about syco from boys. They were telling that they teething a guy. And he gets very mad very quckly. When he gets really mad, he chases them. And they run away. It is dump thing to do, that's what I always though. But, in my mind, I imagined harmless, maybe slightly odd, elderly man. But this guy... Man... This guys look like a killing machine! You would not want to mess around with him.

As I'm thinking that someone from our crowd shouts:
- Hey Syco, we're here!!!

My heart stopped. At that very moment, the guy — a beast of a man, a total unit — turned around and charged at us without a word.

All the other guys broke into a run — they were ready, they knew what was coming. They’d done this many times before. But me? I froze. Blacked out for a split second.

First thought to reach my mind, was the confident version of me saying: "Don't run. You are not with them. You did nothing wrong therefore you are safe".

Then reason kicked in with a counter-argument: "You think he cares? He's not about talk — he’s about violence."

That argument was strong enough. I ran. As fast as I could... The guy was fast, scary fast. But hey, I didn’t need to outrun him. Just the slowest guy in our crowd.

### No choise
And you know today. We can judge yang Viktar. Maybe we can say he could do better. He shuldn't have been there in the first place. And probobly that is true.

But that night I didn't get to chose. I was pulled into a struggle against my will. It did not metter that I don't want to be part of this. That I was there by acident. That I'm sorry. The guy would choew me up and spit me out. Before I would even say a word.

I could not escape the situation. I had to deside what to do...

### This world
Why am I telling this story? Because so often, life is the same way. We get pulled into struggles against our will. We wish things like that would never happen to us. I know how that feels — I’ve had my own battles, and I know some of yours. They’re real. We wish things were different.

But, that's not an option. We can't control that. But we can control how do we go about it! We can utilize the wisdom of this wold. And worship this woldly system. Or we can use God's wisdom. And glorify Him in the choices we make. Unfortunately, it's not that easy. Often times you not gonna be understoo. You not gonna be supportned and accepted by the people of this world. If you will rely on God's wisdom. Often His wisdom looks foolish, counter intuetive, and sometimes offensie to the people of this world. They expect you to act just like them. And they get very upset and sometimes very angry if you don't. 

Even our own flesh rises against us.

> ### Romans 7:19
> ¹⁹For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want.

It takes an effort to do the right thing. It takes corage and dedication to go against the motion. 

### Romans 13:1-14
> ¹Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God.²Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.³For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval,⁴for he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer.⁵Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake of conscience.⁶For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing.⁷ Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.

> ⁸ Owe no one anything, except to love each other...

That's a tough scripture. I might get cancelled to night. Because many of us here tonight. Because of our governing authorities.
