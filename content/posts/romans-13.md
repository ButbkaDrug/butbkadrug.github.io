### Romans 13:1-14
> ¹Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God.²Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.³For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval,⁴for he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer.⁵Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake of conscience.⁶For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing.⁷ Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.

> ⁸ Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law.⁹For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”¹⁰Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.

> ¹¹Besides this you know the time, that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed.¹² The night is far gone; the day is at hand. So then let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light.¹³ Let us walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy.¹⁴But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.

### Opposition
We live in the world where two kingdoms oppose each other. Kingdom of this world or worldly system, opposes God and His kingdom. This opposition is real. And unfortunately for me and you, we don't get the stay neutral. You can't say "I take no sides". It's not an option

### Syco story
I already mentioned that I grew up in a small town. It's a nice place surrounded by forest. You cannot really tell now. But original idea was to build the buildings so that if you look from above, they would come together in a word. USSR. But then, soviet union fell and those plans came to an end. Leaving us only with USS but no R. When I was growing up our town still preserved a bit of that nostalgic, post soviet, slightly depressing atmosphere. Especially in the Autumn. Grey sky, grey buildings, grey roads, grey everything. It get's dark pretty early. Not too much sun. etc.

One of such day. At the evening. When sun was long gone. And darkness swollen the streets me and my friend were walking around. Talking about life. We were teenagers. I guess that's why night time was so attractive. Half of the street light were broken, the other half was pretty dim and very yellow. Creating this post apocalyptic vibe. Most of the people were inside, enjoin their evening, getting ready for bad. Because, our town is not like Batumi. You have to get up very early to go to work, so there are almost no people on the streets after dark. 

So, I'm going down the street with my boddy. We are talking about some teenage stuff. We see some guys from school. We know some of them well, less so some other ounces. We should go and say hello to them.

We came closer. And as we having a small I'm looking around. It's dark, it's quite. I'm slightly cold. Yellow light above the building entrance about 20 miters away trying it's best to light up the night. Not achieving very much to be honest. Some guy walking home by himself. Puffed up jacket makes him look like MMA fighter.

I'm kinda wondering in my thought. Thinking that dim light makes him look huge. And somewhere at the back of my mind I hear one of the boys saying:

- Hey, that's Syco.

Everything that fallowed have happened very quickly. Fractions of the second.

First I thought to myself "Syco"? I've heard about syco from boys. They teething him and then when he gets really mad and tryis to catch them, they run away. But, I've though that they talk about harmless, maybe slightly odd, elderly man. This guys look like a killing machine. You would not want to mess with him.

As I'm thinking that someone from our crowd shouts:
- Hey Syco, we're here!!!

My heart stopped beating. As this huge man turn around and charge at us saying no words.

First thought to reach my mind, was the confident version of me saying: "Don't run. You are not with them. You did nothing wrong therefore you are safe".

Then more reasonable thought took over with a counter argument "Do you think he cares? He is not in the mood to ask question. He is in the mood to fight."

And I ran. As fast as possible. 

### Sides
That night I didn't get to chose sides. I was pulled into a struggle against my will.
