Last Sunday we started our conversation about reality of spiritual world. We talked how modern approach to science and spirit influences us to disbelieve into a spiritual realm. We have uncovered that despite of what we might be taught, science and spirit is not in opposition to each other. And believing in the reality of the spiritual world does not mean rejection of science and return to a stone age, tribal life in caves and hunting mammoths with handcrafted spears. We learned that the world doesn't want to believe in reality of the spirit because:

>### John 4:24
>²⁴God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”

If we believe in God and want to worship him in a true way. We have to accept the reality of spiritual world. We also have to except reality of our enemy, who work against all people in general and against us, as followers of Christ in particular. More specifically we discussed that it not only Spirit of God that can manifest, but there is also **spirit of antichrist** or **spirit of error**, as John calls it later.

We discussed the danger of miss believes and "false prophets". Issues that the church had in the day of John and how it is still relevant, and probably even more important for us today.

>#### 1 John 4:4-6
>⁴Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.⁵ They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world, and the world listens to them.⁶We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error.

**Verse 4** says that there is a confrontation of two worlds. There are those who are form God, and those who are from the world. *"The world"* battle against those who are from God. Remember, not so long ago we discussed that the *world* John refers to is not people, or nature, but ungodly, system, lifestyle inspired and crafted by the enemy. We do not fight against people, even though often, not to say always, Satan uses them to bring us troubles.

Paul writes in Ephesians 6:12:

>### Ephesians 6:12
>¹²For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.

This is our real enemy, not people. God *"desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth(1 Timothy 2:4)."* Let's remember that. 

>...you are from God and have overcome them(verse 4)

Yes, there is a confrontation, the battle. But the winner is already known. Those of God, are on the winning side. It doesn't mean you never gonna have any problems. Otherwise, it is more probable that devoted following Christ will get you in trouble. You will get rejected by this world. You will have issues, and I'm not talking about those that caused by our own foolishness. But, rather confrontation that we experience because of our faith, our believes. This worldly system resist God, and anyone who comes from him is not welcomed.

### Opposition
I already mentioned what is God's dream: 

>### 1 Timothy 2:4
>³...God our Savior,⁴who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

God doesn't want people to parish. God loves people very very much. But the enemy, hates God. He want's to hurt God as much as possible. He can't do it directly, it is not withing his power. So, he does we he can. Enemy targets God's most loved creation **the people**.

God desires all people to be saved and know the truth. But the enemy desires otherwise. To make all people, to ignore, disobey and hate God. In a way enemy want to tell God, *"Look, they love me, they chose me, they follow me, not you..."*. He tries to lead away as many people as possible and cause them to die. Not just physically, but to eternally. To be forever separated from God.

So, people who already live in Enemies kingdom doesn't bother him too much. They already under his control. But those, who is not off his kingdom is complete different topic. Enemy tries to trick them. To lead them astray. To twist the truth. He've been doing it from the beginning of time. And he is very good at it.

Enemy often comes as a friend. As if he cares for you. But, in reality, his only intention is to make you to turn away from God. And one of the best ways to do that, is to mimic the original. To make a fake image, that is very similar to the real thing. And make you believe that it's actually a real one. 

Back in the day, when mobile phones were just taking off. First iPhones just started to get imported and sold where I lived. Many people heard about them, that they are good phones, wanted to try them out. They also saw the images. But hardly anyone actually held them in their hands. And you know what, there were a ton of scammy companies who sold chines low quality replicas that looked like the real thing on the first glance, but of course was not anywhere near iPhone in all regards. But people bought them, thinking it a legit one.

So, people who actually had an iPhone. Would write articles how to spot fake. How to avoid scam. What to look for. What are the differences. 

Today is the same. A lot of people "*sell*" fake Jesus. And ton of people follow them, maybe without even realizing they following a fake image.

### 1 John 4:5,6
⁵ They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world, and the world listens to them.⁶We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error.

Last week we touched this a little. Remember we talked about those who refused to believe that Jesus was actually a man, and had actual, physical body? And how this idea was popular because it would fit peoples worldview. It was easy to believe. And people choice to believe into a fake image.

Same happening in today's world. People on the internet talk good, moral talks. And they are listened to, they are fallowed, acknowledged. Millions upon millions listen to them. You know what is the key to their success?

>they are from the world, they speak from the world => world listens to them...(verse 5)

People of this world doesn't want to submit their way of thinking to God's truth. They will happily accept the fake of the enemy which perfectly fit's their worldview. Which sounds close enough to truth. And the enemy stop bothering them. They already off the path. It's actually even better, because they still think they on the path.

>We are from God...(verse 6)
Who are those "WE" that John refers to?



<!--TODO: Verse 5
    they didn't submit their way of thinking, but twisted bible to align with their worldview. That's why people listen to them, because it align with their ways to begin with.
-->

<!--TODO: Verse 6
    The proper way
-->

>#### 1 John 4:7-12
>⁷Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God.⁸ Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.⁹In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him.¹⁰In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.¹¹Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.¹² No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.

>#### 1 John 4:13-19
>¹³ By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.¹⁴And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world.¹⁵ Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.¹⁶So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.¹⁷By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so also are we in this world.¹⁸There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected in love.¹⁹ We love because he first loved us.
