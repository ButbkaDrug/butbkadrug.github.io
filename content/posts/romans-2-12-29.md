Just as a recap. Last week we talked about issue or Moralism and Hypocrisy. We talked that sin is a sin regardless of who commits it. That what's in my heart is more important then what on the surface. We figured that what's in my heart will show through, will effect my appearance, my conduct, my moral standards. And that's why instead of focusing on the visible side of things, we should promote inner change, which come though our faith in Jesus Christ. Though the work of the Holy Spirit.

### Romans 2:12-29
 ¹²For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.¹³For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified.¹⁴For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.¹⁵They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them¹⁶ on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.

 ¹⁷But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God¹⁸and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law;¹⁹and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,²⁰an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth —²¹ you then who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal?²²You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?²³You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law.²⁴For, as it is written, “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”

 ²⁵For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.²⁶So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded  as circumcision?²⁷Then he who is physically  uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code  and circumcision but break the law.²⁸For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical.²⁹But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God.
