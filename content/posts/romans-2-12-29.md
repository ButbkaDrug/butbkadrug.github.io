Just as a recap. Last week we talked about issue or Moralism and Hypocrisy. We talked that "*sin is a sin*" regardless of who commits it. That what's in my heart is more important then what on the surface. We figured that what's in my heart will show through, will effect my appearance, my conduct, my moral standards. And that's why instead of focusing on the visible side of things, we should promote inner change, which come though our faith in Jesus Christ. Though the work of the Holy Spirit.

And today we will continue to drill into that issue of internal vs external in regards of righteousness and salvation. In this and the following chapter Holy Spirit through Paul lays  down a new foundation, new evaluation system if you will, of one's righteousness. Which is not actually "new", but I would refer to it as an original.

In verses 6 - 11. Paul reminds us that God will judge the world. And he will render to everyone according to his works. 

### Romans 2:6-11
>⁶ He will render to each one according to his works:⁷to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life;⁸but for those who are self-seeking  and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury.⁹There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek,¹⁰but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek.¹¹For God shows no partiality.

You know, we read this verses and it does sound appealing. Especially if you like me, born with a hypertrophied sense of justice, living in this unjust world makes your heart long for justice.


### Romans 2:12-29
 ¹²For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.¹³For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified.¹⁴For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.¹⁵They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them¹⁶ on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.

 ¹⁷But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God¹⁸and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law;¹⁹and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,²⁰an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth —²¹ you then who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal?²²You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?²³You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law.²⁴For, as it is written, “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”

 ²⁵For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.²⁶So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded  as circumcision?²⁷Then he who is physically  uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code  and circumcision but break the law.²⁸For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical.²⁹But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God.
