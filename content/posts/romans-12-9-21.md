## Life of worship
For a last few weeks we've been talking about living the **LIFE OF WORHSIP**. And today we gonna continue with this topic. If you havan't been here for the last couple weeks. We are studing the book of Romans. Currently we're at chapter 12. And at the beginning of chapter we are presented with the concept of a **“living sacrifice”** — a spiritual service of worship that is acceptable to God.

### Question
Did you ever asked yourself a question. What does God want's me to do? What is the will of God for my life?

If you didn't ever thought about it. Well... you probobly should. It is very important question. Because, once you know the answer life start to make so much more sense. And the answer is very simple.

I'm about to revial the secret and sacrid truth, so it's time to pay attaention. If you let this truth to soak in, it will revolutionize your life.

Ready?

**God want's you to live the as if you already in Heaven, while you still here, on earth.**

What? I don't understand. What does it even mean? 

### Example
Yeah, I know how that feels. Many years ago, when I was very yang and naive. I was looking for a secret of singing. I wanted to sing good. Actually, I wanted to be really good. And those days predate youtube and white spread of information. So, I had to digg in into forums and dodgy websites searching for the answer "How to become a good singer". And you would not belive how much rubbish is out there. Hours of my life and liters of tea were waisted on that endless search. But then, one day, luck was on my side.

I found a training programm! It looks very promising. Looks legit! I hit download and start waiting.

Serveral following ours felt endless. But, now I have it. The secret tool that will unlish my voice! 

I had to  wait until I was home alone. And finally, I can go into my room. It is dark hare, because computer monitor is the only source of light. House is so quite, the only noises are from  computer cooler spinning. I can hear my heart pounding in my chest. My palms are sweaty, because I'm so nervouse. What if it's yet another fake?

Few moments of hasitation and then. I sit down and pressed the play button. Music starts to play, and after a short into the vocal coach finally starts speaking. I’m all ears for what he says. And...

> "Keep your throat relaxed and open, so air flows freely and your voice can resonate."

WHAT?

> "Raise your soft palate slightly"

WHAAAT?!

> "Gently bring your vocal folds together without squeezing, letting them vibrate freely."

WHAAAAAAAT?!! Is that it?? That is what I was looking for???

Generally speaking yes. In a nutshell it is the recepe for a great sounding voice.

Luckly, the program included hours and hours of vocal excersises for practice, with the examples to follow.

### Bridge
You know, both, in our christian walk and in singing. It's not about knowing a *"secret formula of a success"*. It's about excersising the right things day ater day. During one of the lessons vocal coach says that one thing that sets professionals apart from ammatures, is that professionals keep practicing their skills day in and day out. They are Working out, building their voice.

Living a **life of worship** is about practicing, excersising or as it put in Philippians 2 "*working out* out selvation".

Before we will dive into our scripture for today, I’d like to preface this by saying everything that we gonna talk about assumes that you are born again, filled with spirit, follower of christ. Because, otherwise, without the help of the Holy Spirit, it will be extremely hard if not imposibble to live the life of worship. But above all it will be prettey much pointless in regards of eternal life. Because again, selvation and forgiveness is not by what you do, but by faith and faith alone.

With that being said let's start reading:

### Romans 12:9-21
>⁹Love *must be* free of hypocrisy. Detest what is evil; cling to what is good.¹⁰*Be* devoted to one another in brotherly love; give preference to one another in honor,¹¹not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord;¹²rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation, devoted to prayer,¹³contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality.

>¹⁴Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.¹⁵Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.¹⁶Be of the same mind toward one another; do not be haughty in mind, but associate with the lowly. Do not be wise in your own estimation.¹⁷Never repay evil for evil to anyone. Respect what is right in the sight of all people.¹⁸If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all people.¹⁹Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath *of God,* for it is written: “VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY,” says the Lord.²⁰“BUT IF YOUR ENEMY IS HUNGRY, FEED HIM; IF HE IS THIRSTY, GIVE HIM A DRINK; FOR IN SO DOING YOU WILL HEAP BURNING COALS ON HIS HEAD.”²¹Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

DO NOT BE OVERCOME BY EVIL

And it starts from transformation of our minds, our worldview, our attituede.
