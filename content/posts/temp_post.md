#Greetings
Greeting brothers and sisters. I'm glad to see you all. Hopefully, you've had a great week. And today we are celebrating Christmas yet again. Isn't that beautiful?! I think, at some point, almost all of us dreamed about celebrating Our own birthdays more then once a year, right? There is even a kids song in Russian that says "Unfortunately birthday comes only once a year".

Well, I have never got to celebrate My birthday twice,  but at least I get to celebrate Jesus's birthday twice a year.

Birthday is an interesting event. Birthday parties usually meant to be memorable. You gather together and do something special to emphasize the importance of a particular person. You bring gifts, eat special food. In attempt to make this day to stand out. Because the person you consider important came into this world on that day. 

You know when we had our first baby(and I know we are not the only once who did that) we celebrated his birthday every month during the first year. Because we were exited! It's a Our child! Even though our financial situation was not that great, we still did that. At list a little cake and maybe tiny bit of something little special. It was important. It was significant for us. 

But in the same time even though we get to celebrate Christmas twice a year, often I see that people outside the church and in the church not very exited about it. We live in the country which potentially was the first country to become Christian. But tell me, how much excitement and celebration you see around the Christmas day. And then we can go ahead and compare it with a New Year celebration. Also, we can examine your own attitude. I think something is a little bit off here. 

I think people not exited about birth or Christ anymore.  Maybe because it doesn't mean much for them. Because even though often we hear the words about Savior and what not. We don't really give it a thought. We come to church almost, as if we don't have another choice. As if we "have too...".

We hear about Savior being born. But for some reason it does not makes us very exited. Our hearts doesn't pound faster. Savior?? OK, cool. But what does it really mean to you?

I think at least part of the reason why we not very exited about the Savior. Is because, we don't feel like we have need to be saved. Maybe you doing well in life. You not a bed person. So, you not in any kind of trouble or anything. Why you need to saved? Saved from what?

#Death
I think we missing out on something. We probably forgot some important thing. You have an enemy. This enemy is a real deal.  Because, it is Death. You might be like "Woooooow. I did not see that one coming?! Hold on, what?!". Yeah, In the beginning God created life:

>"Then the Lord God took dust from the ground and made a man. He breathed the breath of life into the man’s nose, and the man became a living thing. Genesis 2:6"

You see, the "breath of live" is something that made all the difference. I believe it is the reason why we are living things. Why we hold on to life so much. And even in the most horrible obstacles we chose to live. It is God's breath within us. 

But then some one screwed up. And did something, that shouldn't have been done. And let sin and Death into this world. And the truth is that since then we all destined to die. Because of disobedience of one man we all cursed. And there is no way around it.  there is nothing you can do about it. 

>21 Death comes to people because of what one man did... 1 Corinthians 15: 21

Bible tell us that #death is our ultimate enemy. And we can not defeat it. We do not like to hear about it or think about it. We do not talk about it. I don't like it. I don't want to die. I'm not ready... 

In Luke 12 there is a parable about a rich man who got sudden success. And thought he can finally rest and enjoy the life. But God says  to him "You fool, You gonna die tonight..."

In this regards we all equal. Reach and poor. Successful and not. Healthy and sick... We'll all gonna get there. There are only couple of people in the bible who didn't experienced death. And Son of God not even one of them...

But, BIble also tell us that physical death isn't the end. Actually, according to the bible that's not what we should be afraid of. Even though that scares the hack of me. Bible says:

>"Don’t be afraid of people. They can kill the body, but they cannot kill the soul. The only one you should fear is God, the one who can send the body and the soul to be destroyed in hell. Matthew 10:28"

You will exist even when your body dies. And then you only have two options:
- Eternal life with God
- Eternal death without God. "There you will cry and grind your teeth with pain. Luke 13:28"

But, we all sinners. None of us are perfect. And Bible tells us that the penalty for sin is death. Also, bible tells us that sinner cannot go to heaven and be with God. We are in the big trouble. You know and since most of us not even Jewish, who are "God's special people". No one there to help us.

We messed up bit time as the people. And if you think that if you would be Adam or Eve you would do different, you just fooling yourself. We separated ourselves from our creator. We shoot ourselves into foot. And now eternal death is all what we deserve. We screwed. That it. I mean, there is no hope. Unless... There is...

#Savior

You know on the regular night, regular shepherds in the field experienced something supernatural. They saw an Angel who proclaimed a good news : 

[[Today your Savior was born in David’s town. He is the Messiah, the Lord. Luke 2:11]]


You know once we had no hope. And I know there are days when we lose hope. Those days when maybe we have no strength. When maybe we almost wish our life to be over. We almost wish for nothing to be out there when we'll go. Maybe you filled with pain physical or emotional. May be your life to much to take at the moment. If that's you: I want to encourage you: 

>"Savior was born in David's town"

And he was born to save us. Save us from eternal death. He was born to give us hope and good future. To bring peace and justice. He was born because he cares. If you think about it. Jesus had a choice. 

Ether to be born as a regular human. To live a perfect life(which is really really hard to do). And then to die a horrible death without even being guilty of anything. 

Or Not to do it. He was not obligated. He did that because of you and me. Because he cares. Because...

[[...There is a veil covering all nations and people. This veil is called “death.” 8 But death will be destroyed forever. And the Lord God will wipe away every tear from every face. In the past, all of his people were sad, but God will take away that sadness from the earth. All of this will happen because the Lord said it would.]]

And  yes, we've being cursed and predestined to die because of a sin. But as :

[[ Death comes to people because of what one man did. But now there is resurrection from death because of another man. 22 I mean that in Adam all of us die. And in the same way, in Christ all of us will be made alive again. 1 Corinthians 15:21-22 ]]

There are a lot of amazing things and promises available to us because the of baby being born. 

[[You are his chosen people, the King’s priests. You are a holy nation, people who belong to God. He chose you to tell about the wonderful things he has done. He brought you out of the darkness of sin into his wonderful light. 10 In the past you were not a special people, but now you are God’s people. Once you had not received mercy, but now God has given you his mercy. 1 Peter 2:10]]

We have a reason to be exited. We have something celebrate and rejoice. OUR savior was born. We are not on our own anymore. We are his special people now. He chose US. I want you to think about a moment. 

God became a man, in order to save people, all the people. From THEIR sins. By giving up his life. He conquered death for us. We don't have to be afraid anymore. Now we have life. Now we have hope. So, be exited! Your savior being born!!! The one who will make wrong right. The one who will rescue you. 

Isn't it something worth celebrating? Isn't it something to be exited about?

>8 That night, some shepherds were out in the fields near Bethlehem watching their sheep. 9 An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord was shining around them. The shepherds were very afraid. 10 The angel said to them, “Don’t be afraid. I have some very good news for you—news that will make everyone happy. 11 Today your Savior was born in David’s town. He is the Messiah, the Lord. 12 This is how you will know him: You will find a baby wrapped in pieces of cloth and lying in a feeding box.”

>13 Then a huge army of angels from heaven joined the first angel, and they were all praising God, saying,

>14 “Praise God in heaven, and on earth let there be peace to the people who please him.” Luke 2:8-14

So, if you here today. And maybe you never actually considered to follow Jesus. May be it is your fist time in the church. Or maybe you going to church for years but, it's more of habbit at this point, something that you have always done and the meaning is faded away. You not exited anymore. Please, come and we will pray together.
