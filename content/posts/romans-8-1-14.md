### Intro
<!--NOTE: Fill in from voice notes -->

### Problem
At the end of the chapter 7 we presented with an issue. Since the law is *only(not actually)* an indicator and not the remedy very quickly we come to a problem.

### Romans 7:25(second part)
²⁵...So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.

Paul tells us that even those who genuinely, whole heartily desire to follow God law. Inevitable fail because our nature is corrupt. Remember the issue of original sin. So, even when in our mind we admire God's law, our flesh is still rebels against it.

#### Example of a king David
Think of kind David for example. Great man of God. Loved God with all his heart. He wrote more then half of all Psalms. Approximately 6 times more then any other known writer of the book of Psalms. All that to say that he was passionate about God. And during his reign as a king of Israel, we can see how much he respected God. David tried his best to follow God's law. God himself calls David a "Man after His own heart".

### Acts 13:22
>²² ...he(God) raised up David to be their king, of whom he testified and said, ‘I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will.’

Kind David was committed and dedicated to God. And never the less he had his own fails. David was a great king. Being a great person, he's fails was great as well. Here are some highlights.

| Failure                 | Context
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Adultery with Bathsheba | Had sexual relationships with someone else's wife, while, her husband was at war fighting for David. Minwhile David himself had at least 6 wives of his own at that moment |
| Murder of Uriah         | Orchestrates murder of the husband to cover up the act of adultery, because woman became pregnant          |
| Failure as a father     | His own son rebelled against him and started a civil war                                                   |
| Unauthorized census     | Conducts census because of questionable reasons and as a result 70,000 die as a divine punishment          |


We not gonna dive deep into this stories. Each of them have their own lessons for us. But it shows us that even the person who love God from the depth of his heart is not able to escape corruption of the original sin. You and I are not any better then David. Our nature is corrupt and law of God clearly shows that. Utilizing God's law, sin brings condemnation and death.

Paul makes it clear in the chapter 7 that law does not provide solution to the problem. And therefore following the law does not save you. Law brings condemnation. Law requires justice.

### Solution
But because God loves us so much he takes care of this indeed complex problem.

### Romans 8:1-4
>¹There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.²For the law of the Spirit of life has set you  free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death.³For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh,⁴in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.

### Justification comes through Jesus Christ.
By the grace of God there is a solution. And solution is in Jesus Christ. He came *in the likeness of sinful flesh and fulfilled the will of the father, so that requirements of the law might be fulfilled in us.*

Jesus Christ did all the hard work. He fulfilled the righteous requirement of the law. And because of him those righteous requirement might be fulfilled in us.

### Who are us?
Who are "us"? Is it for Jews? Is it for Gentiles? Who is considered eligible?

Verse 1 says that it is only for those who are **IN CHRIST JESUS**. It is for those who believe in Him. Those who "got baptized into Christ Jesus". Those who was "born again". There is many names to describe this state. And in our today's scripture it says:

Those *who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit*.


### Walk in the Spirit

### Romans 8:2
>²For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death.

We are no more called to live be the letter of the Law. But rather by it's Spirit. In His letter to the church in Corinth Paul writes a famous phrase

> ### 2 Corinthians 3:6-11
> ⁶...For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.

What does it mean to live or walk by the Spirit?

### Romans 8:5
> ⁵For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.



















* We find justification in Christ Jesus.
* We get baptized into Christ we die for the law of sin and death, and rise for the law of the Spirit. Not anarchy. 
* Who are those who are in Christ Jesus?(walk according to the spirit)























### Romans 8:1-14
>¹There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.²For the law of the Spirit of life has set you  free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death.³For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin,  he condemned sin in the flesh,⁴in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.⁵For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.⁶For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.⁷For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot.⁸Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.

>⁹You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him.¹⁰But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness.¹¹If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus  from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.

>¹²So then, brothers,  we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.¹³For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.¹⁴For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons  of God.
