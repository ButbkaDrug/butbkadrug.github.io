### INTO 
We will continue with the letters of Paul. He have written a few. 13 of the book of the new testament are weidely considered to be written by Apostle Paul. We just finished letter he wrote to the church in Rome.

Chronologically it sits in the middle and has been written between 55-58 A.D. Letters to Galatians, Thessalonians, and Corinthians predate letter to Rome. First 3 of his letters even predates the gospels.

It's not that it all that important. It is porbobly not gonna rovlutionize your life. It's just interesting facts that I picked up during my study and research. It is quite interesting when you try to map out all the evenets in chronological order. It helps to see a bit more connection and reasoning. You stop viewing New Testament as a collection of random scripts, you can see how it all comes together into a sotry. Story that we can and should learn from.

We not goonna go back and to the start. Even though I'll confess I had this thoughts. Instead we will pick up from where we left. And continue into a next letter written by Paul. 

Probobly today we not going to actually study. We will rather pay attention to the context. Which is very important. But unfortunatelly often neglected. Which then leads to a missinterpretation of the bible.

### Example

Imagine yourself walking itnto a cookware store. Stacks of plates, skillets, knifes, forks. You name it. A lot bright light. Shelves full of kitchenware. Nicely dressed reletevely yang man aproaches you and asks:
- "G'day sir. Do you want to buy a pot? We have the best kind! Hight qality product! You are not going to regret the purchase, trust me!!!"

Keep this picture in mind as we shift to a different place. 

It's dark, slightly misty night alley. You walking home, curling up into your warm jacked. And another kind of a yang  man approaches you. Drassed in all black. Hoodie covers his face. His hand are in his pockets. His jeense proboly x5 times the size he actually need. He comes closer and says:


- "G'day sir. Do you want to buy a pot? We have the best kind! Hight qality product! You are not going to regret the purchase, trust me!!!"

<!--NOTE: Not the best example but I'll keep it for now. -->

Same words. Completely different meaning. Isn't it?


### Context
So, we should not discard the context. Unfortunately way to often people do just that. They ruch to their conclusions, their intepretation. Their vision without letting the Bible, letting the text to speak for itself.

Here in Calvary Chapel we beleive in the bible as a Word of God. And as many other churches around the world we utilize Inductive Bible Study method. In a nutshel we **let the bible speak** for itself. And we learn what it has to say.

### Back to matter
When Paul writes his letter to to Rome, he is phycisally located in Corinth. If you remember at the end of the letter, Paul writes about his plans, to go to Jerusalem and then visit Rome. 

### Romans 15:30-31
 ³⁰...I urge you, brothers *and sisters,* ...to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me, ³¹that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea...

Paul anticipates some troubles there. And Paul were right. If we would read Acts starting in chapter 21 we can close that gap. And see how Paul arrives to Jerusalem. Then  as Paul call them in his letter "those who are disobediant" are making serious troubles for Paul.

He almost get's killed by the Jews. But, Roman officials save him from the crowd. Oh man, It's an epic story. After failing to kill Paul on the spot, Jews plot his assasination. But, that get uncovered and Paul were sent away from Jerusalem under the gurad of 470 solders. Can you Imagine? 

- 200 solders

- 200 spearman

- 70 horseman

All were protectin Paul on the way to Caesarea. From were eventually he begins his voyage to Rome. He is shipwrecked for three months on the island of Malta(Acts 27). And then finally Paul arrives in Rome and remains under house arrest (Acts 28:16–31). And that's when he writes letter to Philippians. 

Roughly speaking in year 57 Paul writes his letter to Rome. The one that we just got done studing. And only 5 year later. In a year 62(again it's an approximation) he finally get's there. After at least two assosination attempts. Aften being impressoned for several years. After a shipwreak and more. He end up being under "house arrest" in Rome. Constantly watched and guarded by the Roman solder.

Paul utilizes this time to write four letters. Order of the first and second is debatable. But we will start from the letter to Philippians.









Part 1: Context & Background (Pre-Study)
Before diving into individual verses, observe the "big picture" of the letter. 

    Author: Paul (and Timothy), writing as "servants".
    Location: Paul is in prison (likely Rome, c. AD 60–62).
    Audience: The church in Philippi, the first European church (see Acts 16).
    Tone: Joyful, personal, and encouraging; it is often called the "Letter of Joy".

1. Observation: What does it say?
Before interpreting, you must gather all the facts of the passage to see it as it truly is. 

    - Ask the "5 W's and an H": Identify Who is involved, What is happening, When and Where it occurs, Why the author wrote it, and How it unfolds.

    - Mark Key Details: Look for repeated words, contrasts (using words like "but"), comparisons ("like"), and lists.

    - Identify Logical Connectives: Notice words like "therefore," "so that," or "because," which bridge ideas and show the author's flow of thought.

    2. Interpretation: What does it mean?
This step moves from the "what" to the original author's intended meaning for their original audience. 

    - Context is King: Examine the historical and cultural background. Consider what comes immediately before and after the passage.

    - Scripture Interprets Scripture: Use cross-references to see how other parts of the Bible address the same themes.

    - Word Studies: Look up key words in their original Greek or Hebrew to uncover deeper layers of meaning.

    - Consult Resources Last: Only after your own study should you use tools like the Blue Letter Bible or commentaries to check your conclusions.

3. Application: How does it apply to me?
The ultimate goal is a transformed life. 

    - Make it Personal: Ask, "Is there a sin to avoid, a promise to claim, or a command to obey?".

    - Concrete Action: Determine one specific way your behavior or thinking should change this week based on the truths discovered.

# Inductive Bible Study Guide: The Book of Philippians (Question-Based)

This guide provides a framework using the Observation, Interpretation, and Application (OIA) method, structured purely as questions for you to answer directly from the text.

## Observation: What Does It Say?

*Focus purely on the facts presented in the passage. Use highlighters or colored pencils to mark key words.*

### Passage-Specific Questions:
1.  **Who** is writing this letter, and **who** is the intended audience? (1:1)
2.  **When** and **where** is the author writing from? What clues indicate his circumstances? (1:7, 1:13)
3.  **What** specific words are repeated most often throughout the entire book? (e.g., *joy*, *rejoice*, *gospel*, *mind*)

## Interpretation: What Does It Mean?

*Move beyond the facts to uncover the author’s original intended meaning for the first-century reader.*

### Contextual and Thematic Questions:
1.  **What** does "partnership in the gospel" (1:5) mean in the cultural context of the Roman Empire?
2.  **Why** would Paul's imprisonment lead to *more* boldness in sharing the gospel? (1:12–14)
3.  **What** is the significance of the "Hymn of Christ" (2:5–11)? What was Paul trying to teach the Philippians about humility and status?
4.  **How** does Paul's warning against the "mutilators of the flesh" (3:2) connect with his testimony about his own Jewish heritage (3:4–6)?
5.  **What** is the difference between "working *out* your salvation" (2:12) and earning salvation by works?
6.  **What** does Paul mean by "the peace of God that surpasses all understanding"? (4:7)

4.  **How** can you practically use Paul's "thought list" in 4:8 to combat negative thinking in a specific area of your life?
5.  **Who** is a "worthy example" in your life that you can thank and emulate (2:19–30)?
6.  **What** one change in behavior will you make this week as a direct result of studying this book?
