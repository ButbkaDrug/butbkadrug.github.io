### INTRO 

Hello Church. For the last 3 weeks we had a little break from our regular study. You've got to enjoy some other preachers, not only me.

We've had wonderful guests (well, technically Andrey is not a guest, but never the less he did great too!) And it's totally ok to have a break every once in a while to have a guest speaker or a topical sermon. Nothing wrong with that. I hope you enjoyed it.

With that said I think we're ready to go back to our regular study. If you are new here. In Calvary Chapel we study the Bible chapter by chapter, verse by verse. From the beginig of the book to the end. Looking at what the Bible has to say to us... We let the word of God speak and we learn to apply it's truth to our lifes.

And as you might remember, time has come for us to start a new book. Because we finshed Romans just before I left. And I'm happy to tell you that we will continue to study letters of Paul. Paul has written a few over the course of his ministry. **13** books of the New Testament are widely considered to be written by Apostle Paul.

We just finished a book of Romans. And chronologically the letter to Romans sits in the middle of the list. After letters to Galatians, Thessalonians, and Corinthians.

### Fun fact
Fun fact for you if you will. Did you know that Letters to Galatians, Thessalonians and Corinthians were written before the Gospels? I didn't know that until just recently.

It's not like it is all that important. But, I think it's cool. And now you know that too.

### Mapping out events
It is surprisingly interesting to try to map out events of the new testament in chronological order. I was doing just that during my preparations. It's really helps to see more connection and reasoning between different parts of a Bible. You stop viewing New Testament as a collection of random scripts. But instead they all start to come together into a story. Story that we can and should learn from.

Today we attept to do just that. Instead of jumping from one book to another, we will try to "build a bridge" between the two.

### Not from the start
So, what is our next book?

Our next book will be the letter to Philippians. We will pick up were we left. At the end of Romans. And trace what happened between the time when Paul wrote letter to Rome and letter to Phillipians.

### Context
Today we will have less of a sermon and deep dive into history. We will have an overview, gather some context. Historical background and so on. Things which will help us to better understand the text.

### Back to matter
What is actually helpful to know when you study biblical text?

- Who wrote that text?
- Where was the author when he wrote that?
- Under which circumstances?
- Who are his original recipients/target audiance of the text?
- Is there something special or unique about recipient or location or time of the writing?

All this factors will have an impact and will be reflected in the text. Knowing the answers to this questions is very helpful in order to derive the authors intent. And it will also help us to understand how this truth applies to our life.

So, let's find the answers to these questions.

### Who? 
We know that apostle Paul was the author of this letter. How do we know that? Easey

### Philippians 1:1
>¹Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus... 

With this one it's pretty clear. Because Paul names himself right in the verse 1.

### Where is Apostle Paul
Where was Paul when he wrote the letter?

At the time he wrote his letter he was in prison. I believe that he is under the house arrest in Rome. How do we know that?

### Philippians 1:12,13
 ¹²Now I want you to know, brothers *and sisters,* that my circumstances have turned out for the greater progress of the gospel,¹³so that my imprisonment in *the cause of* Christ has become well known throughout the praetorian guard and to everyone else,

### Connection to Romans
Wait. Last thing we knew about Paul, is that he was in Corinth, writing a letter to Rome. Letting them know he want's to visit them right?

Let's briefly talk about what happened between letters to Romans and Philippians. Because there is a 5 year gap between the two.

If you remember at the end of the letter to Romans Paul writes that he needs to visit Jerusalem before he can come. Paul also request prayer regarding that:

### Romans 15:30-31
 ³⁰...I urge you, brothers *and sisters,* ...to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me, ³¹that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea...

Paul anticipates some potential troubles in Jerusalem. He was not clueless about the risks of going there. In fact I think he was well aware of what's coming. But decided to go anyway. In Acts 21 Luke sheds some light on the events:

### Acts 21:10-14
>¹⁰As we (Luke, Paul, Timothy, Silas) were staying there (Ceasarea on their way to Jerusalem, this is righ after Paul sent the letter to rome) for some days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.

>¹¹And he came to us and took Paul’s belt and bound his own feet and hands, and said, “This is what the Holy Spirit says: ‘In this way the Jews in Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and hand him over to the Gentiles.’ ”

>¹²When we had heard this, we as well as the local residents *began* begging him (Paul) not to go up to Jerusalem.

> ¹³Then Paul replied, “What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”

>¹⁴And since he would not be persuaded, we became quiet, remarking, “The will of the Lord be done!”

### Jerusalem
And it happend exactly like the prophet said. In short - Paul arrived in Jerusalem. Then "those who are disobedient" as Paul called them in the letter, caused some serious trouble for him.

Paul almost gets killed by the mob when he visits the Temple. Roman soldiers save him from the Jews. It's an epic story really, You should check it out. It's all in Acts.

But those Jews were not to give up easily. After failing to kill Paul on the spot, they made a clever plan to assassinate Paul. Unfortunately for them, they have leaked that information and Romans send Paul away from Jerusalem under the guard of 470 roman soldiers. Can you Imagine?

- 200 soldiers

- 200 spearmen

- 70 horsemen

All were protecting Paul. Escorting him to Caesarea. And from there eventually Paul was sent to Rome.

### Time gap.
There is a 5-year long jurney between Paul's letter to the Romans and him actually arriving to Rome.

After at least two assassination attempts. After 2 years in prison in Ceasarea. After a surviving a shipwreck and more. He ends up under the "house arrest" in Rome. Constantly watched and guarded by the Roman soldiers.

And that's where we find him at the time of his writing the letter to Philippians. 

Quite a journey isn't it?

In the end Paul actually get's to Rome even though not the way he initiall planned.


### RECAP
So, let's recap this little part. Paul sent a letter to Rome about his coming. Returnes from Jerusalem. Get's arrested and eventually excorted to Rome as a prisoner. Remening under the house arrest while waiting for his trial.


### Who? Philippians
Ok. We figured our what happened to Paul. Now let's see about Philippians. Who they are and why Paul is writing a letter to them?

Philippians are the believers from the city of Philippi. In Macedonia.

Father of Alexander the Great, Philip II conquered this city and renamed it after himself to Philippi.

Much later an important battle happened there. Between Roman republicans and imperialists. Republicans lost. Which ensured among other things that Romans should worship deified dead emperor. Which always was a point of contention between Christians and Roman authorities. Especially in the Philippi. Why?

Because after that important battle, Philippi was enlarged and became a Roman colony. Discharged soldiers were given land there to settled in the city. So, quickly the city of Philippi became full of former Roman soldiers and officers. Who were extremely loyal to Rome and worshiped Emperor as a diety. And they also firmly believed that everyone should do so too.

That's the brief history of Philippi the city.

Now what connects Paul and Philippi?

### Connection with Paul
Very condensed version is that during second missonary trip(about 10 years before the letter to Philippi) Paul and his companians were tring to go to new region called "Asia Minor" to preach the Gospel. But Holy Spirit prevents the twice. 

Then, right after that Paul get's a vision of a Macedonian man calling for help. So, they immidiately go there. Full story in Acts 16. 

They get to the city of Philippi. Which was a central city of Macedonia. And started the first Christian church in Europe. Yes, if you never thought about it Philippian church was the **fist one** in Europe.

The highlight of their time in Philippi, and you probably remember this stories, is when young slave-girl possessed with an evil spirit was following Paul and Silas for days. Until Paul got very annoyed and casts the evil spirit out.

Which brought them not praise, but a great deal of trouble. Paul and Silas got arrested, beaten up and put into prison. But then God set them free via massive earthquake. Which also brought to fatih the main jailer.

Another great story worth checking out.

So, to recap Philippi - is the main city of Macedonia. Full of retired soldiers and full or Roman influence. First church to be founded in Europe by Paul, Timothy, Apostle Luke and Silas. 

### Why
With that I think we have enough historical data. And we can come back to Paul, who is under house arrest in Rome. Waiting for the trial.

### Why Now?
The question that I had in my head is: **Why Now**? Why Paul have decided to write this letter at this stage?

### The answer
The answer is simple. This letter is a "Thank you" letter. Philippians collected financial support for Paul and sent it with a trusted man from their church named Epaphroditus.

And along with the money Epaphroditus also have brought the news. An update of what's going on in the fellowship.

We will see Paul's reflection on the issues as we study the letter. But all in one Paul wants to thank Philippians for their care and support.

### Conclusion
But what can we learn today. Apart from important history and some interesting facts? Those will come in handy later as we go through the letter.

But as of today what do we learn?

We got to explore the path of an apostle Paul. What have happen to him in between two letters that we study.

### FIST
Fist this that we learn is that Paul - was a simple man. Just like any one of us. He wasn't any kind of superhuman or anything like that. No. *Regualr fella*.

As well as his companions. Regular people, just like me and you. **Dr. Luke** who wrote the gospel of Luke and the book of Acts. **Timothy** and **Silas**. They were not some sort of a uber spiritual almost out of this world super humans. Not at all. Look at them:

### Acts 21:12
>¹²When we had heard this(what will happend to Paul in Jerusalem), we ... *began* begging him not to go up to Jerusalem.

Look at their reaction. Regualr humans, with regular human reaction. With an exception that those regular humans chose to trust the Lord. Because without a trust, they would quckly get dissapointed, maybe even lose their faith in site of everything that have happened.

And funny thing about trust. Is that **Trust** is no like *on/off* switch. Like you ether trust in the Lord or you dont. No, it more like a scale.  There are different degrees of trust, which come with expiriance. Every time we go through something in the Lord. Our ability to trust him grows.

At First you only able to trust in little things. Than little more and little more. We going to come back to this more in depth as we progress through the letter.

### Isaak
Trust it's just like our muscules. For example Isaak can bench press way more then me. Twice my body weight if I'm not mistaken. Was he born with this ability?

- No.

Did he got to this weight his first day in gym?

- No.

Gradually increasing the weight you make your muclies stronger and more capable.

Thougout the course of His life Paul's capacity to trust God grew tromandesly. And eventually He was able to trust the Lord fully:

### Act 21:14
>¹⁴And since he(Paul) would not be persuaded, we became quiet, remarking, “The will of the Lord be done!”

## What
What does it mean for us?

It means that as we study the bible, and we see something remarkable,  we should not say. "Well... those are **APOSTILES**. With a capital A. And I'm not like that. I'm just regular guy.

Just like in a song - *"I'm just a boy inside a man. Not exactly who you think I am..."*

One one hand Bible were written by devine insperation of God. But in the same time it was written by the regular people just like ourselves. For the regular people just like ourselves.

The stories that we read, stories that we share should help us to trust the Lord more. 

What is your area where you need to trust the Lord today?
