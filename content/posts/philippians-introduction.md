### INTRO 
<!-- Good intro  -->

Last 3 weeks we had a little break from expositional study. We had a break from me preaching. We've had a few really nice guests (Andrey is not a guest, but he did great too!) And it's ok to step back every once in a while and talk about a certain topic as God leads. I hope you enjoyed it.

Now I think we're ready to go back to our regular way of learning the Bible. If you are new here. In calvary chapel we study the Bible chapter by chapter, verse by verse. Looking at what the Bible has to say to us. We let the word of God speak into our life.

Time has come for us to advance to a next book. And I'm happy to tell you that we will continue with the letters of Paul. Paul has written a few of them over the course of his ministry. **13** books of the New Testament are widely considered to be written by Apostle Paul.

We just finished studying a letter to the Roman church. And chronologically the letter to Romans sits in the middle of the list. After letters to Galatians, Thessalonians, and Corinthians.

### Fun fact
Fun fact for you if you will. Did you know that Letters to Galatians, Thessalonians and Corinthians were written before the Gospels? I didn't know that until just recently.

It's not like it is all that important. Probably not gonna revolutionize your life or view of the Bible. But, I think it's fun to know. And now you know too.

### Mapping out events
It is surprisingly interesting to try to map out events of the new testament in chronological order. I think it helps to see a bit more connection and reasoning between different parts of a Bible. You stop viewing New Testament as a collection of random scripts. But instead they all start to come together into a story. Story that we can and should learn from.

### Not from the start
We're not going to start from the first letter of Paul. Even though I should confess I did consider that. Instead we will pick up from where we left. Book of Romans. And advance to the next letter. Which is Letter to Philippians.

### Context
Today we will have an overview, gather a little bit of context. Historical background and so on. Which will help us to better understand this letter. And will help to prevent misinterpretation.

### Back to matter
What is actually helpful to know?

- Who wrote the letter?
- Where was the author when he wrote that letter?
- Under which circumstances?
- Who are his original recipients of the letter?
- What is special or unique about them or location or time in which it was written etc.?

It will have an impact and will be reflected in the text. So, let's find the answer to these questions.

### Who? 
We know that apostle Paul was the author of this letter. How do we know that?

### Philippians 1:1
 ¹Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus... 

With this one it's pretty clear. Because Paul names himself right in the verse 1.

### Where is Apostle Paul
Where was Paul when he wrote the letter?

At the time he wrote his letter he was in prison. I believe that he is under the house arrest in Rome.

### Connection to Romans
Let's briefly talk about what happened between letters to Romans and Philippians.

If you remember at the end of the letter to Romans Paul writes about desire to visit them. But he says that he needs to visit Jerusalem first. And at the end of his letter Paul request prayer:

### Romans 15:30-31
 ³⁰...I urge you, brothers *and sisters,* ...to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me, ³¹that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea...

Paul anticipates some troubles in Jerusalem. He was not clueless about the risks of going to Jerusalem. He was well aware but decided to go there anyway. In Acts 21 we read:

### Acts 21:10-14
>¹⁰As we (Luke, Paul, Mark, Silas) were staying there (Ceasarea on their way to Jerusalem) for some days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.

>¹¹And he came to us and took Paul’s belt and bound his own feet and hands, and said, “This is what the Holy Spirit says: ‘In this way the Jews in Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and hand him over to the Gentiles.’ ”

>¹²When we had heard this, we as well as the local residents *began* begging him (Paul) not to go up to Jerusalem.

> ¹³Then Paul replied, “What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”

>¹⁴And since he would not be persuaded, we became quiet, remarking, “The will of the Lord be done!”

### Jerusalem
And that is exactly what happened. In short Paul arrived in Jerusalem. Then "those who are disobedient" as Paul called them in the letter, caused some serious trouble for Paul.

He almost gets killed by the mob when he visits the Temple. Roman soldiers save him from the mob. It's an epic story really, You should check it out.

But those Jews were not to give up easily. After failing to kill Paul on the spot, they made a clever plan to assassinate Paul. Unfortunately for them, that information gets leaked and Romans send Paul away from Jerusalem under the guard of 470 roman soldiers. Can you Imagine?

- 200 soldiers

- 200 spearmen

- 70 horsemen

All were protecting Paul. Escorting him to Caesarea. And From there Paul eventually was sent to Rome.

### Time gap.
There is a 5-year gap between Paul's letter to the Romans and his actually arriving in Rome. After at least two assassination attempts. After being imprisoned for several years in Ceasarea. After a surviving a shipwreck and more. He ends up under "house arrest" in Rome. Constantly watched and guarded by the Roman soldiers.

And that's where we find him at the time of writing letter to Philippians. 

Quite a journey isn't it?

### Who are the Philippians and Why does Paul write a letter to them?
Now, let's see who are the Philippians and why Paul is writing a letter to them?

### Who?
As you can imagine Philippians are the believers from the city of Philippi. In Macedonia.

Father of Alexander the Great, Philip II conquered this city and named it after himself Philippi.

Much later there was an important battle there. Between Roman republicans and imperialists. Republicans lost. the Roman empire remained imperialistic. Which ensured among other things the worship of the deified dead emperor. which became a point of contention between Christians and Romans. Especially in the Philippi. Why?

Because after this battle, Philippi was enlarged and became a Roman colony. Discharged soldiers were given fertile land to farm and settled in the city. So, the city of Philippi was full of former Roman soldiers and officers. Who were extremely loyal to Rome and worshiped Emperor. And firmly believed that everyone should do so too.

That's the history of Philippi. But what connects Paul and Philippi?

### Connection with Paul
Well, much later Paul, Silas, Mark and apostle Luke. came together to Philippi and started a church there. during the so-called "second missionary journey". The major goal of the second journey was to support churches that were founded during the "first missionary journey".

But when they have finished visiting existing churches, Paul tried to advance into a new region called "Asia Minor" and preach there. But Holy Spirit did not allow for that. Actually they were stopped twice by the Holy Spirit. Then Paul got a vision of a Macedonian man calling for aid. You can read the full story in Acts 16. 

That's how they got to Philippi. And started the first Christian church in Europe.

The highlight of their time in Philippi, and you probably remember this part, is when young slave-girl possessed with an evil spirit was following Paul and Silas for days proclaiming that they are ministers of God almighty. Until Paul got very annoyed and cast evil spirit out.

which brought them a great deal of trouble. Paul and Silas were beaten up and put into prison. But then God set them free via massive earthquake. Which also brought the main jailer to faith.

Another great story worth checking out.

So Philippi - main city of Macedonia. Full of retired soldiers and Roman influence. First church to be founded in Europe. 

### Why
Now let's go back to Apostle Paul at the present time (time of the writing the letter I mean).  We should fast-forward 10 years. This is how much time has passed since they have founded the church in Philippi.

Now Paul is under house arrest in Rome. Waiting for the trial.


### Why Now?
The question I had in my head is: why now? Why has Paul decided to write a letter 10 years after?

### The answer
The answer is simple. This letter is a "Thank you" letter. Philippians collected financial support for Paul and sent it with a trusted man from their church named Epaphroditus.

And with the money Epaphroditus also have brought the news. An update of what's going on in the fellowship. We will see Paul's reflection on the issues as we study the letter.

But all in one of the major highlights of this letter is "Joy". Paul says words like joy and rejoice a lot. Which is interesting considering that he himself is in prison.
