### START
Greetings brothers and sisters. The Christmas season has arrived. Advent has already begun. We know that Advent is not a biblical concept. It is a tradition that came later. But I think it's a good one.

Even though we do not follow many traditions in Calvary Chapel, sometimes we adopt the best ones.

In the last few years we have done special talks during the Advent season, like many Protestant and Orthodox churches. We focus on Christmas topics such as “Peace”, “Love”, “Joy”, and “Hope”. It helps us slow down and reflect on the birth of Christ. What does Christmas really mean for us? What has changed in this world because He came?

Today we will light our first candle, and talk about Peace.

### Peace
Peace is a very good thing. There are many different definitions of peace. But in general, it means:

>**Peace is a state of calm and harmony where there is no conflict, fear, or violence**

Or if we talk about inner state of a person:

>**It is when someone feels safe, and not worried or disturbed.**

We all like to feel at peace, don’t we? It is very natural for us to long for peace.

For our family, peace is when we go to the sea early in the morning. We drive to our secret spot in Gonio. Before you even see the water, you can already feel the salty breeze. You walk closer and lie down by the waves. They rock gently. No one is around. The sun shines on you. You feel calm and relaxed. You feel at peace.

How many of you would like to do that instead of going to work tomorrow?

We love peace. It feels good. And we don’t like the opposite of peace — fear, disturbance, and distress. We don’t want those. That’s for sure.

Stress is a silent killer. It destroys you from the inside out. Nobody enjoys it. You age faster than you should. You become prone to many diseases. Your physical and mental health suffers greatly:

**According to the internet**:
>"High stress leads to serious physical issues like heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, weakened immunity, and digestive problems, plus mental health impacts such as anxiety, depression, irritability and so on and so forth."

### Blessing
On the other hand, peace is like a magic pill. It protects you from those negative effects. It is good for both your physical and mental health. Being at peace can literally extend your life. Peace is a great blessing that comes from God.

### 2 Thessalonians 3:16
>¹⁶Now may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every circumstance. The Lord be with you all!


The peace that comes from the Lord is something different. It is bigger and better than what this world calls peace. Only God has a real thing. The Bible talks a lot about it. We have been studying the book of Romans for the last few months, and here is what we find there:

### Romans 5:1
>¹Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have **peace with God** through our Lord Jesus Christ,

### Romans 12:18
>¹⁸If possible, so far as it depends on you, **be at peace** with all people.

### Romans 14:19
>¹⁹So then we pursue the things which **make for peace** and the building up of one another.

And these are only a few mentions. There are more.

But even from these few we can see God’s desire. His will is for me and you to be at peace:

* With Him — to be reconciled and repent.

* With ourselves — to have inner peace.

* With one another — both in and outside the Church.

### Peace with God
First, and most importantly, the most fundamental level of peace in our life is peace with God — the reconciliation made possible through Jesus Christ.

Long ago, we broke that relationship. We chose to live by our own wisdom, to follow our own will, and to decide for ourselves what is good and what is evil. We wanted to be like God.

### Genesis 3:5 serpent says to Eve:
⁵...God knows that on the day you eat from ~it~(this tree) your eyes will be opened, and you will become like God, knowing good and evil.”

And our response was:
[VIDEO: I Want it all]

We have said, “I want it all! And I want it now!” Just like in the parable of the prodigal son, we left our Father’s house to live on our own, following our own wisdom and doing our own will. In doing so, we broke our peace with God.

### John 
A few weeks ago, on Sunday, I was walking to church. The day was wonderful. Amazing weather. No wind. The sun was shining, flooding the streets with bright light. It was not too hot, not too cold. Just perfect.

As I was approaching the intersection here, I ran into a guy — let’s call him John. John used to come to our church every now and then a couple of years ago. I stopped to say hi, and we started talking.

Our conversation ended up being quite long. I knew he had been a member of a different church in Batumi for many years, but I also knew he had left that church some time ago. We talked about faith and God, and he said something like this:

"I don’t care about eternity. All I want is to be happy right here, right now. I don’t want to do God’s will. I want to do mine. And if God’s will happens to go the same way… well… great. I don’t mind. I just want to live my life my own way."

### Story repeats itself
You see, the story repeats itself. We still fall for this. Eight thousand years of recorded history in the Bible, and we still fall for “You will become like God, knowing good and evil…” Even today, we deny peace with God to try to be the Lord of our own lives.

### Therapy
And later we find ourselves at the therapist asking:
> “Is there anything I can do for anxiety and stress?”

> "Yes! Rest in God’s will. Prescribed daily."

Go back to the Father. Give in to His will. Put your trust in Him, and He will give you peace. This will help with your stress and anxiety.

When we come back to the Father, He will not kick us out. He is waiting for us. He wants us to come back!

We should stop trading the peace we can have with God for the lies this world offers. We should stop wearing ourselves out with stress and anxiety, trying to figure out life on our own — always restless, always anxious.

We can have the peace of God, if we reconcile with Him through Jesus, the Prince of Peace.

### Isaiah 9:6
⁶For a Child will be born to us, a Son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.

It was written about 800 years before the birth of Christ. The great promise - promise of peace.

### Prince of Peace
Jesus came to reconcile us with the Father. He came to give us peace — true peace. And it begins with one essential step.

If you are not at peace with your Father in heaven, you cannot have true peace within yourself.

...

If you are not at peace with your Father in heaven, you cannot have true peace within yourself.

...

People search for peace in alcohol, in drugs, in relationships, in wealth, in fame, in their careers — all kinds of things. Sometimes they find something they call peace or happiness. But there is only one source of true peace.

### John 14:27
²⁷ Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you...

### Source
True peace can be found in a manger. The only source of peace is Jesus. Only through Him can we have true peace — a peace that does not depend on circumstances, well-being, financial stability, or anything else.

> "With faith in God and His Son, with the receiving of His Spirit and His peace, we can have an untroubled heart in a quite troubled life." (David Guzik)

True peace is not about escaping troubles or having an easy life. True peace is being untroubled in any circumstances.

### Story
A few years ago, I had a minivan — a Mazda 5. [PICTURE MAZDA] I claimed that, despite its look, it was as good as any SUV. I gave the suspension a lift. It had a powerful engine, wide wheels, and big rims. To me, it felt like an SUV. I never got stuck anywhere while driving it.

On the other hand my friend Matt also had an SUV. [ PICTURE PRADO ] With big, fat tires, locking differential. Lowered gears. All the good stuff.

Driving around Batumi, Tbilisi, and nearby areas on our regular routes, I didn’t feel much difference between the two — except for the appearance, of course.

But one day we decided to go to Khikhani fortress [ PICTURE KHIKHANI ]. Together with our families. The fortress located near Khulo. It's in the mountain Adjara. Very close to the border with Turkey.

We took off from Batumi, and while we were on the asphalt, both cars performed really well. When we hit a light gravel road, I was still confident. My SUV was driving just fine.

But the further we went, the worse the road became — more bumps, deeper holes. Matt kept plowing through them with confidence. I, on the other hand, grew more and more worried that we might not make it.

I had to slow down. I had to maneuver like crazy to avoid the bumps and holes, using all my driving knowledge and experience. But despite my efforts, we soon had to come to a complete stop. My homegrown SUV could not go any further. The road had become too rough.

That day I learned something important. No matter how much I wanted my car to be an SUV, it was not. When it faced a real test, it became obvious.

...


Just like my DIY SUV could not keep going when the road got rough, the illusion of peace that this world offers disappears in the face of real trouble
...

Only the peace that comes from God continues, no matter the circumstances or obstacles.

>Only God's peace allow us to **"maintain untroubled heart in a quite troubled life."**

### Isaiah 9:6
⁶For a Child will be born to us, a Son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.

The true source of peace cannot be found in alcohol, drugs, or success. True peace was found in a manger. Only in Jesus Christ can we have a true sense of peace.

### 2 Thessalonians 3:16
>¹⁶Now may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every circumstance. The Lord be with you all!

The Prince of Peace offers His peace to you tonight. If you struggle with anxiety, stress, or brokenness, the solution is to come back to the Father — to surrender to Him and rest in His will. He, as a good Father, will give you peace.













<!-- ### Recipients 
When Jesus says "Peace I leave with you..." He talks to his disciples, his followers. Not youtube or instagram kind of followers. On social network you can follow as many people as you like. Social networks our days is mostly for entertaining.

When it comes to Jesus. It is "pick up your cross and follow me" type of following we talking. Exclusive following. When disciples of John the baptist heard that Jesus is the lamp of God. They left John and followed Jesus.

His peace if for followers. Not for fans. Not enjoers. Not for subscribers.

So, if you struggle with feeling true peace. Maybe the reason is that you not yet truly following Him? Maybe you are still more of a subscriber that a true follower? Or maybe you are trying to sit on the fence. It's not gonna work, sorry.

Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.











### Eternity -
During our conversation John said: *"I don't care about eternity. Only thing that matters is this life I have now."*. 

And honesty. I think a lot of us have similar mindset. At least our life testify that. We trying to squeeze every second of our life here on earth. To make sure we live as long as possible and as good as possible. And that's becomes our goal in life. Yes, we maybe coming to church. Maybe we pray every now and then. But in reality all our time, money, energy is invested into good living here. And not really into life eternal. 

A 100 years here on earth is probobly the best we can hope for. And it goes by quickly! Eternity on the other hand is so much longer. According to bible. Life here on earth is a demo version. Stripped down version of a real life God have for us. Life that's so good we can't even imagine. Why do we trade full version we can have, to a demo?



### John 14:27
²⁷ Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.


### John 16:33
³³I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.”

### Romans 14:17
¹⁷ For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.

Phl 4:7
