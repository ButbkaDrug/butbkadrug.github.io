### START
Greetings brothers and sisters. Christmas season has arrived. Advent has already started. Of course we know that advent is not a biblical concept. It's a tradition that came around later. But I think, it's a good one.

Even though we do not follow too many traditions in Calvary Chapel. Sometimes we adopt the best once's.

Last few years as we do special talks during advent season. Like many other protestant and orthodox churches. Focusing on Christmas related topic such as "Peace", "Love", "Joy", "Hope". It helps us to slow down and reflect back on the birth of Christ. What does Christmas actually mean for us? What have changed in this world with His coming.

Today we will going to light up our first candle. And talk about **Peace**.

### Peace
Peace is very good thing. We can find many different definitions to what is peace, but all in all:

>**Peace is a state of calm and harmony where there is no conflict, fear, or violence**

Or if we talk about inner state of a person:

>**It is when someone feels safe, and not worried or disturbed.**

We like to feel at peace don't we? It is very natural for us to long for peace. For our family it is when we go to the see early in the morning. Usually we drive to our secret spot in Gonio. Before you even see the water you can feel salty breeze. You come closer to the water. Lay down and watch the waves rock slightly. No one is around. Sun shines on you. You feel calm and relaxed. You feel at peace.

How many of you with to do that instead of going at work tomorrow?

We love peace. It feels good. And we don't like the opposite of peace. Which is fear, disturbance, distress. We don't want those. That's for sure.

Stress is a silent killer. Destroying you from the inside out. Nobody enjoys it. You age prematurely. You get prone to all kinds of deceases. Your physical and mental state suffers greatly:

**According to the internet**:
>"High stress leads to serious physical issues like heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, weakened immunity, and digestive problems, plus mental health impacts such as anxiety, depression, irritability and so on and so forth."

### Blessing
On the other hand Peace is like a magic peel. It saves you from all those negative effects. It is good for your physical and mental health. Being at peace quite literally extends your life. Peace is a great blessing that comes from God.

### 2 Thessalonians 3:16
>¹⁶Now may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every circumstance. The Lord be with you all!

We've been studying the book of Romans for the last few month now and here is what we find there:

### Romans 5:1
>¹Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have **peace with God** through our Lord Jesus Christ,

### Romans 12:18
>¹⁸If possible, so far as it depends on you, **be at peace** with all people.

### Romans 14:19
>¹⁹So then we pursue the things which **make for peace** and the building up of one another.

And that's only few mentions. There is more.

But even reading a few we can see what is God's desire. His will for me and you to be at peace:

* With Him. To reconcile and repent

* With ourselves. To have inner peace.

* With one another in and out of Church.

### Peace with God
First and the most important, most fundamental level of peace that we should have in our life. Is Peace with God. Reconciliation that was made possible through Jesus Christ.

Long time ago we broke that relationship. We chose to live by our own wisdom. To do our own will. To define ourselves what is good and what is evil. We decided to be like God.

### Genesis 3:5 serpent says to Eve:
⁵...God knows that on the day you eat from ~it~(this tree) your eyes will be opened, and you will become like God, knowing good and evil.”

And our response to this was:
[VIDEO: I Want it all]

We've said "I want it all! And I want it now!". Just like in the parable about prodigal son. We have departed from our fathers house. To live on our own. By our own wisdom. To do our own will... We broke our peace with God.

### John Doe...
Few weeks ago. On the Sunday I was walking to the church. The day was wonderful. Amazing weather. No wind. Sun shines, flooding the streets with bright light. It was not too hot, not cold. Just perfect weather.

As I was getting close to the intersection here. I ran into a guy, let's say his name was John. John used to come to our church every now and then couple years ago. I stopped to say "Hi" and we've talked.

Our conversation end up being quite lengthy. I knew that he was a member of a different church in Batumi for many years, but I also knew that he left the church some time ago. We discussed a few thing about faith and God. And he said something along the lines:

>"I don't care about eternity. All I want is to be happy right here, right now. I don't want to do God's will. I want to do mine. And if God's will happened to go the same direction... Well... Great... I don't mind. I just want to live my life, my own way."

You see, story repeats itself. We still fall for this. 8000 years of recorded history in the bible. And we still fall for **"You will become like God knowing good and evil..."** To this day we deny peace with God. In order to be the Lords of our lives.

### Therapy
And later we find ourselves at the therapist asking:
> “Is there anything I can do for anxiety and stress?”

> "Yes! Rest in God’s will. Prescribed daily."

Go back to the Father. Give in to His will. Put your trust in Him, and He will give you peace. That will help your stress and anxiety.

When we come back to the Father. He not going to kick us out. He is waiting for us, **He wants** us to come back!

We should stop trading peace with God that we can have, to the lies this world offers. We should stop killing ourselves with stress and anxiety of trying to figure out this life on our own. Always restless, always anxious. 

We can have peace of God. If we will reconcile with God. Through Jesus. Through the Prince of Peace.

### Isaiah 9:6
⁶For a Child will be born to us, a Son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.

It was written about 800 years before the birth of Christ. The great promise. Promise of peace.

### Prince of Peace
Jesus come to reconcile us with the Father. He came and give us peace. True peace. Which starts with one essential step.

If you not gonna be at peace with your Father who is in heaven. You will not be able to have true peace in you.

...

If you not gonna be at peace with your Father who is in heaven. You will not be able to have true peace in you.

...

People search for peace in alcohol, in drugs. In relationships. In wealth, in fame. Career. All kinds of things. Sometimes they find something they call peace and happiness. But there is only one source of true peace.

### John 14:27
²⁷ Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you...

### Source
The only source of peace is Jesus. Only through Him we can have **true peace**. Peace that does not depend of the obstacles, does not depend on well being, financial stability or anything else. 

> "With faith in God and His Son, with the receiving of His Spirit and His peace, we can have an untroubled heart in a quite troubled life." (David Guzik)

True peace is not about escaping troubles and having an easy life. True peace is when you stay untroubled in any circumstances.

### Story
Few years ago I had a minivan **Mazda 5**. [ PICTURE MAZDA] I claimed that, despite the look of it, it is as good as any SUV. I gave suspension a lift. It had powerful engine. Wide wheels. Big rims. It felt like SUV to me. I never got stuck anywhere driving it.

On the other hand my friend Matt also had an SUV. [ PICTURE PRADO ] With big, fat tires, locking differential. Lowered gears. All the good stuff.

Driving around my regular routes I did not felt much difference between the two. Except for the appearance of course.

But one day we decided to go to Khikhani fortress [ PICTURE KHIKHANI ]. Together with our families. The fortress located near Khulo. It's in the mountain Adjara. Very close to the border with Turkey.

We took of from Batumi and while we were on the asphalt, both cars performed really well. When we hit light grovel road I was still confident. My SUV was driving just fine. But further we drove. Worse of the road we've had. More bumps. Deeper holes. Matt continued to plow through them with confidence. But as for me, I was more and more worried that we not gonna make it.

I had to slow down. I had to maneuver like crazy to avoid those bumps and holes. Exercising all of my driving knowledge and experience. But despite all my efforts soon we had to come to a complete stop. My homegrown SUV could not take us any further. Road became too rough.

That day I've learned. No matter how hard I wanted my car to be an SUV, it was not. When it got to a real test. It became obvious. 

Just like my DIY SUV could not keep going when the road got rough. Illusion of the peace that this wold offers will vanish in the face of real trouble.

Only the peace that comes from God will continue despite the circumstances. In any obstacles.

>Only God's peace allow us to **"maintain untroubled heart in a quite troubled life."**

### Isaiah 9:6
⁶For a Child will be born to us, a Son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.

Prince of Peace offers you his peace tonight.














<!-- ### Recipients 
When Jesus says "Peace I leave with you..." He talks to his disciples, his followers. Not youtube or instagram kind of followers. On social network you can follow as many people as you like. Social networks our days is mostly for entertaining.

When it comes to Jesus. It is "pick up your cross and follow me" type of following we talking. Exclusive following. When disciples of John the baptist heard that Jesus is the lamp of God. They left John and followed Jesus.

His peace if for followers. Not for fans. Not enjoers. Not for subscribers.

So, if you struggle with feeling true peace. Maybe the reason is that you not yet truly following Him? Maybe you are still more of a subscriber that a true follower? Or maybe you are trying to sit on the fence. It's not gonna work, sorry.

Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.











### Eternity -
During our conversation John said: *"I don't care about eternity. Only thing that matters is this life I have now."*. 

And honesty. I think a lot of us have similar mindset. At least our life testify that. We trying to squeeze every second of our life here on earth. To make sure we live as long as possible and as good as possible. And that's becomes our goal in life. Yes, we maybe coming to church. Maybe we pray every now and then. But in reality all our time, money, energy is invested into good living here. And not really into life eternal. 

A 100 years here on earth is probobly the best we can hope for. And it goes by quickly! Eternity on the other hand is so much longer. According to bible. Life here on earth is a demo version. Stripped down version of a real life God have for us. Life that's so good we can't even imagine. Why do we trade full version we can have, to a demo?



### John 14:27
²⁷ Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.


### John 16:33
³³I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.”

### Romans 14:17
¹⁷ For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.

Phl 4:7
