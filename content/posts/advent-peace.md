### START
Greetings brothers and sisters. Christmas season has arrived and advent has already started. Of course we know that advent is not a biblical thing. It's a tradition that came around later. But I think, it's a good one.

Even though we do not follow too many traditions in Calvary Chapel. Sometimes we adopt the best once's. It's already few years as we do special talks during advent season. Like many protestant and orthodox churches do. Focusing on Christmas related topic such as "Peace", "Love", "Joy", "Hope". It helps us to slow down and reflect back on the birth of Christ. What does Christmas actually mean for us? What have changed in this world with His coming.

Today we will going to light up our first candle. And talk about **Peace**.

### STORY *** ???

### Peace
Peace is very good thing. It can have many definitions and occur on different levels. But all in all:

>**Peace is a state of calm and harmony where there is no conflict, fear, or violence**

Or if we talk about inner state of a person:

>**It is when someone feels calm, safe, and not worried or disturbed.**

We like to feel at peace don't we? It is very natural for us to long for peace.

Because alternatives to peace are fear, disturbance, distress. And we don't want those. That's for sure. Stress is a silent killer. Destroying you from the inside out. Nobody enjoys it. You age prematurely. You get prone to all kinds of deceases. Your physical and mental state suffers greatly:

**According to the internet**:
>"High stress leads to serious physical issues like heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, weakened immunity, and digestive problems, plus mental health impacts such as anxiety, depression, irritability, and difficulty concentrating, affecting sleep, focus, and overall well-being."

### Blessing
On the other hand Peace is almost a magic peel. It saves you from all those negative effects. It's a great blessing that comes from God.

### Romans 15:33
³³Now the God of peace *be* with you all. Amen.

To be at peace is very good. Good for physical and mental health. Being at peace quite literally extends your life. AND it is also the will of God for you.

In the book of Romans we read:

### Romans 5:1
 ¹Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have **peace with God** through our Lord Jesus Christ,

### Romans 12:18
¹⁸If possible, so far as it depends on you, **be at peace** with all people.

### Romans 14:19
¹⁹So then we pursue the things which **make for peace** and the building up of one another.

And that's only few mentions. There is more even when we only look at the book of Romans.

God's desire. His will for me and you to be at peace:

* With Him. To reconcile and repent

* With ourselves. To have inner peace.

* With one another in and out of Church.

### Peace with God
First and the most important type of peace that we should have in our life. Peace that was made possible only through Jesus. Is peace between us and God. Long time ago we broke those relationships. We chose to live by our own wisdom. Create our own truth. To define ourselves what is good and what is evil.

### Genesis 3:5 serpent says to Eve:
⁵For God knows that on the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will become like God, knowing good and evil.”

And we have said "I want it all! And I want it now!". Just like in the parable about prodigal son. We have departed from our fathers house. To live on our own. By our own wisdom.

### John Doe...
Few weeks ago. On the Sunday I was walking to the church. The day was wonderful. Amazing weather. No wind. Sun shines flooding streets with bright light. Not too hot, not too cold. Perfect.

I was almost here when I ran into a guy, let's say his name was John. John used to come to our church every now and then couple years ago. I stopped to say "Hi" and we've had a talk. It was quite lengthy. I knew that he was a member of a different church in Batumi, but I also knew that he left church some time ago. We discussed a few thing about faith and God. And he said something along the lines:

"I don't care about eternity. All I want is to be happy right here, right now. I don't want to do God's will. I want to do mine. And if they happened to go the same direction... Great. I just want to live my life, my own way."

You see, story repeats itself. We still fall for this. "You will become like God knowing good and evil..." And we deny peace with God. In order to be the Lords of our lives.

### Therapy
And later we find ourselves at the therapist asking:
> “Is there anything I can do for anxiety and stress?”

> "Yes! Rest in God’s will. Prescribed daily."

Go back to the Father. Give in to His will. Put your trust in Him, and it will give you peace. That will help your stress and anxiety.

When we come back to the Father. He not going to kick us out. He is waiting for us, he wants us back! We should stop trading peace with God that we can have, to the lies this world offers. We should stop killing ourselves with stress and anxiety of trying to figure out this life first try. Always restless, always anxious. 

We can have peace with God. Through Jesus. Through the Prince of Peace.

### Isaiah 9:6
⁶For a Child will be born to us, a Son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.

It was written about 800 years before the birth of Christ. The great promise. 

### Prince of Peace
Jesus come to reconcile us with the Father. He came to give us peace. And true peace starts with this essential step. Unless you have peace with your Father who is in heaven. You will not be able to have true peace in you.

People search for peace in alcohol, in drugs. In relationship. In wealth, in fame. Career. All kinds of things. But there is only one source of true peace.

### John 14:27
²⁷ Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you...

### Source
True source of peace is in Jesus. Only through Him we can have **true peace**. Peace that does not depend of the obstacles, well being, financial freedom or anything else. 

> "With faith in God and His Son, with the receiving of His Spirit and His peace, we can have an untroubled heart in a quite troubled life." (David Guzik)

True peace is not about escaping troubles and having an easy life. True peace is when you stay untroubled in any circumstances.

### Story
Few years ago I had a minivan. I claimed that it is as good as any SUV. I gave suspension a lift. It had powerful engine. I never got stuck anywhere I drove.

On the other hand my friend Matt had a real SUV. Big tires, locking differential. All the good stuff.

Once we decided to go to Khikhani fortress together with our families. It's kinda near Khulo. Close to the border with Turkey.

We took of from Batumi and while we were on the asphalt, both cars performed really well. When we hit light grovel I was still confident. But further we drove. Worse of the road we've had. More bumps. Deeper holes. Matt continued to plow through them with confidence. But as for me, I was more and more worried that we not gonna make it. I had to slow down. I had to maneuver like crazy to avoid those bumps and holes. Exercising all of my driving knowledge and experience. But despite all my efforts soon we had to come to a complete stop. My homegrown SUV could not take us any further. Road became too rough.

That day I've learned. No matter how hard I wanted my car to be an SUV, it was not. When it got to a real test. It became obvious.

Just like my DIY SUV could not keep us when the road got rough. Peace that this wold offers will vanish in the face of real trouble.

Only the peace that comes from God will continue despite the circumstances. In any obstacles.

>**"Ability to maintain untroubled heart in a quite troubled life."**

### Recipients 
When Jesus says "Peace I leave with you..." He talks to his disciples, his followers. Not youtube or instagram kind of followers. On social network you can follow as many people as you like. Social networks our days is mostly for entertaining.

When it comes to Jesus. It is "pick up your cross and follow me" type of following we talking. Exclusive following. When disciples of John the baptist heard that Jesus is the lamp of God. They left John and followed Jesus.

His peace if for followers. Not for fans. Not enjoers. Not for subscribers.

So, if you struggle with feeling true peace. Maybe the reason is that you not yet truly following Him? Maybe you are still more of a subscriber that a true follower? Or maybe you are trying to sit on the fence. It's not gonna work, sorry.

### Isaiah 9:6
⁶For a Child will be born to us, a Son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.

Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.




























### Eternity - <!--FIX: Probobly does not really fit in the topic of peace-->
During our conversation John said: *"I don't care about eternity. Only thing that matters is this life I have now."*. 

And honesty. I think a lot of us have similar mindset. At least our life testify that. We trying to squeeze every second of our life here on earth. To make sure we live as long as possible and as good as possible. And that's becomes our goal in life. Yes, we maybe coming to church. Maybe we pray every now and then. But in reality all our time, money, energy is invested into good living here. And not really into life eternal. 

A 100 years here on earth is probobly the best we can hope for. And it goes by quickly! Eternity on the other hand is so much longer. According to bible. Life here on earth is a demo version. Stripped down version of a real life God have for us. Life that's so good we can't even imagine. Why do we trade full version we can have, to a demo?



### John 14:27
²⁷ Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.


### John 16:33
³³I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.”

### Romans 14:17
¹⁷ For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.

Phl 4:7
