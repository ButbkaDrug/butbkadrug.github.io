### Intro
We are officially finished the book of Romans. Congraculations everyone! It didn't take us too long. We have started with Romans on the first week of May 2025. So, It took us about 8 mounth to go from the beginning to the end. 16 chapters of fundamental truth. Rough calculations will give us 2 chapters a month speed. Not bad.

You probobly thinking "Ok, we done with Romans. It's all good. But, what's next? Where do we go now?". I've thought about it too. And you know what? We not going to go anywhere just yet. Because of multiple reasons. One of them being that I would have to leave for few weeks. And we will have visitors coming and sharing the word. Some of them you know, some of them will be new people for you. But they all great trustworthy people of God. And I'm sure of them that they will preach good, healthy message.

So, thinking of that I did not wanted to start a new book and then to have a several week break, right after that. Instead I had something differant on my heart.

### Exams
I wanted us to reflect yet again. Re-evaluate where do we place bible, the word of God in our life? And I know that we all know **"the right answer"**. But, I don't want you to tell me the right answer. I want you to look back over the last 8 mounth. And to see, how much your life changed due to the studiyng book of Romans. 

We can say that we just finished a comprehensive unit in the school of God. And time have come for the evaluation.

Bible is not ment to be just read. Bible ment to be applied directly into our lifes. But let's be honest with ourselves How much biblical influence do we allow in our life?



### James 1:22-25
²²But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not just hearers who deceive themselves.²³For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror;²⁴for *once* he has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was.²⁵But one who has looked intently at the perfect law, the *law* of freedom, and has continued *in it,* not having become a forgetful hearer but an active doer, this person will be blessed in what he does.

### James 1:22-25
 ²²But don’t just listen to God’s word. You must do what it says. Otherwise, you are only fooling yourselves.²³For if you listen to the word and don’t obey, it is like glancing at your face in a mirror.²⁴You see yourself, walk away, and forget what you look like.²⁵But if you look carefully into the perfect law that sets you free, and if you do what it says and don’t forget what you heard, then God will bless you for doing it.


### Matthew 7:24-27
 ²⁴“Therefore, everyone who hears these words of Mine, and acts on them, will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.²⁵And the rain fell and thefloods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and *yet* it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.²⁶And everyone who hears these words of Mine, and does notact on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.²⁷And the rain fell and thefloods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell—and its collapse was great.”


### Luke 6:46-49
 ⁴⁶“Now why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?⁴⁷Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and acts on them, I will show you whom he is like:⁴⁸he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock; and when there was a flood, the river burst against that house and *yet* it could not shake it, because it had been well built.⁴⁹But the one who has heard and has not acted *accordingly* is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation; and the river burst against it and it immediately collapsed, and the ruin of that house was great.”
