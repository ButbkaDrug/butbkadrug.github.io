### Intro
Last week we are officially finished the book of Romans. Congratulations everyone! It didn't even take us that long. We have started Romans on the first week of May 2025. So, It took us about 8 mounth to go through the whole book. From the beginning to the end. 16 chapters of solid, fundamental truth. Rough calculations will give us speed of 2 chapters per month. Not bad.

And now we at the stage when one can say: *"Ok, we done with Romans. What's next? Where do we go now?"*.

I've thought about it. And you know what? We not going to go anywhere just yet. Because of multiple reasons. One of them being that I would have to leave for few weeks. And we will have guest speakers coming and sharing the word with us. Some of them you know, some of them will be new for you. But they all great, trustworthy people of God. And I'm sure of them that they will bring very good, very healthy and helpful message.

Having that in mind I did not wanted to start a new book. Because  we would have to have a several week break, right after we start.

But also, in the same time, a few weeks ago I had... Maybe we can call it a conviction. A topic come to my mind. Topic that I beleive we should cover. 

And that what we will do today. 

### Luke 6:46-49
> ⁴⁶“Now why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?

> ⁴⁷Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and acts on them, I will show you whom he is like:⁴⁸he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock; and when there was a flood, the river burst against that house and *yet* it could not shake it, because it had been well built.⁴⁹But the one who has heard and has not acted *accordingly* is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation; and the river burst against it and it immediately collapsed, and the ruin of that house was great.”

This scripture is at the very end of so called *Sermon on the Maintain*. Which is basically an outline of how we should live. It's probably the most famous. Maybe even the most important sermon of Jesus. Definitely it's one of the most quoted paces of scriptures. And considered to be **the core** of christian living.

All that to say "It's extremely important". So, we better pay attention to what it says. I want us to have a closer look at verse 46:

### Luke 6:46
> ⁴⁶“Now why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?

In modern translation it sounds like:

### Luke 6:46(NTL)
 ⁴⁶“So why do you keep calling me ‘Lord, Lord!’ when you don’t do what I say?

### LORD, LORD
This is important question. But before we will break it down. First let's gather a little bit of a context. Who Jesus is talking to? Who He is asking?

We can see that this question addressed exclusively to the people, who call Jesus *Lord, Lord*. But, what does is mean?

Now, you probably already know this, but repetition of the word "Lord" is deliberate. In Hebrew and Aramaic speech, repetition intensifies meaning. In other words.

**Calling Jesus “Lord, Lord” implies:**
* devotion
* loyalty
* belonging
* public confession

Jesus addresses those who claim to be His devoted, loyal followers. In the modern terms we would say. That it is people who go to church on Sundays. Who sing during worship. Have all the right answers. They know all the right words. They **LISTEN**, they **HEAR** the WORD. They "follow" Jesus.

Potentially Jesus can speaks about me and you. We all can fall into this category. Because it is hard to tell real followers from superficial.

### THE PROBLEM
The major difference between truly devoted followers and superficially devoted followers. Is that the other once's **do not DO** what Jesus say. They listen, they hear, they "follow" Jesus around. But they **do not do what he say**.

This kind of people were around Jesus back in the day. They are here tonight. They like the ideas of Jesus. They are just not into doing things His way.

### TO DO
The word **DO** also means **make**, **produce**. Following is not merely LISTENING, HEARING or READING the word. It is about applying. It is about doing, producing fruit, making difference. **ACTING UPON IT**

Unfortunately we live in the world of consumption. When we trained to just endlessly consume. We listen to the podcasts or sermons non stop. Thinking that makes us more spiritual. Makes us better Christians. As soon as we finish one book, podcast, sermon. We jump to the next one. And then the next one. So on and so forth.

We like the ideas and words. But we rarely bother to do the work necessary to internalize that knowledge. We do not act upon it. We do not take time to practice.

We consume so much and act so little that eventually we become spiritually obese. We say that "I need this to grow. I do it for my spiritual growth." When in reality you consume just for the sake of it, because it feels good. And you want more.

### Difference in worldview
I think it is a real problem. In the modern world we adopted "Greek" style of learning. Where the highest activity is **theōria**. Observation. In the world of **theōria** highest goal is understanding, possessing the knowledge. Application is not important and often unnecessary. It is a worldview in which **knowledge is the goal**.

This is how we study in our schools. This is how we study in the university. We spend first 20 years of our life mastering the art of **theōria**. Gathering knowledge without ever acting upon it. We know so much, but most of the time we don't even know what to do with all that information. Because in the world of **theoria** understanding of the concept is the goal.

That is why today one consider himself **an expert** after watching couple videos on YouTube or reading a book on the topic. I've definitely been guilty of that.

And then you you 


### EXAMPLE
The Princess Bride (1987) Scene: Vizzini vs. Westley (battle of wits)
or
Wizard Duel: Severus Snape vs Gilderoy Lockhart

### 
And without realizing it, we take this approach and apply it to all spheres of our life. We listen and watch, watch and listen or read. And it feels good. Feels like we getting better, wiser. We get more insight, new knowledge, new revelations. It feels like we learn something, making progress!






### Luke 6:47
> ⁴⁷I will show you what it’s like when someone comes to me, listens to my teaching, and then follows it.

### Luke 6:49
> ⁴⁹But the one who has heard and has not acted *accordingly* is like a man who...

The both types of people they came, they have listened to the teaching. The diffarance is that one acted opon it and the other did not. As we read illustration we see that for a while diffarance was not apparant. Until the troubles come. Then it became obvious.

Do you remember earthqake in Malatia in 2023?














### Hunger. Good food vs Bad food
Ideas that you hear they sound fake. They sound like someone elses words. 
After a while you just can tell that, someone got hooked up. It shows in their vocabulary, in their phrasing. 


Maybe we start right. We lack knowledge, or wisdom and we start the search. But then, before we know we, it turns into recreational consumtion. We actually already found the answer. But we 


We missing fundamental step. Practicing. You can't truly know something, unless you master it by repeated practice. All the pro's go back to fundamentals all the time. But every time they do, they uncover new side of it. In pretty much any craft. 

We stopped internelizing information. We offloaded our critical thinking. And that's what the world want's you

### Exams
I wanted us to reflect yet again. Re-evaluate where do we place bible, the word of God in our life? And I know that we all know **"the right answer"**. But, I don't want you to tell me the right answer. I want you to look back over the last 8 mounth. And to see, how much your life changed due to the studiyng book of Romans. 

We can say that we just finished a comprehensive unit in the school of God. And time have come for the evaluation.

Bible is not ment to be just read. Bible ment to be applied directly into our lifes. But let's be honest with ourselves How much biblical influence do we allow in our life?

### Romans 12:2
²And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.



### This makes discipleship existential, not academic.



### James 1:22-25
²²But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not just hearers who deceive themselves.²³For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror;²⁴for *once* he has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was.²⁵But one who has looked intently at the perfect law, the *law* of freedom, and has continued *in it,* not having become a forgetful hearer but an active doer, this person will be blessed in what he does.

### James 1:22-25
 ²²But don’t just listen to God’s word. You must do what it says. Otherwise, you are only fooling yourselves.²³For if you listen to the word and don’t obey, it is like glancing at your face in a mirror.²⁴You see yourself, walk away, and forget what you look like.²⁵But if you look carefully into the perfect law that sets you free, and if you do what it says and don’t forget what you heard, then God will bless you for doing it.


### Matthew 7:24-27
 ²⁴“Therefore, everyone who hears these words of Mine, and acts on them, will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.²⁵And the rain fell and thefloods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and *yet* it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.²⁶And everyone who hears these words of Mine, and does notact on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.²⁷And the rain fell and thefloods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell—and its collapse was great.”


### Luke 6:46-49
 ⁴⁶“Now why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?⁴⁷Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and acts on them, I will show you whom he is like:⁴⁸he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock; and when there was a flood, the river burst against that house and *yet* it could not shake it, because it had been well built.⁴⁹But the one who has heard and has not acted *accordingly* is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation; and the river burst against it and it immediately collapsed, and the ruin of that house was great.”
