### Intro
Last week we officially finished the book of Romans. Congratulations, everyone! It didn’t even take us that long. We started Romans in the first week of May 2025. So, it took us about eight months to go through the whole book, from beginning to end. Sixteen chapters of solid, foundational truth. By rough calculation, that’s a pace of about two chapters per month. Not bad.

And now we’re at the stage where one might say: *"Ok, we’re done with Romans. What’s next? Where do we go now?"*

I’ve thought about it. And you know what? We’re not going to go anywhere just yet, for a few reasons. One of them is that I’ll be away for a few weeks. During that time, we’ll have guest speakers coming to share the Word with us. Some of them you already know, and some of them will be new to you. But they are all great, trustworthy people of God, and I’m confident they will bring very good, healthy, and helpful messages.

With that in mind, I didn’t want to start a new book, because we would have to take a several-week break right after starting it.

But at the same time, a few weeks ago, I had—maybe we can call it a conviction. A topic came to my mind, a topic that I believe we should cover.

And that’s what we’ll do today.

### Luke 6:46-49
> ⁴⁶“Now why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?

> ⁴⁷Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and acts on them, I will show you whom he is like:⁴⁸he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock; and when there was a flood, the river burst against that house and *yet* it could not shake it, because it had been well built.⁴⁹But the one who has heard and has not acted *accordingly* is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation; and the river burst against it and it immediately collapsed, and the ruin of that house was great.”

This scripture is at the very end of the so-called *Sermon on the Mount*, which is basically an outline of how we should live. It’s probably the most famous—maybe even the most important—sermon of Jesus. It’s definitely one of the most quoted passages of Scripture and is considered to be **the core** of Christian living.

All that is to say, *"It’s extremely important."* So we’d better pay attention to what it says. I want us to take a closer look at verse 46:

### Luke 6:46
> ⁴⁶“Now why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?

In modern translation it sounds like:

### Luke 6:46(NTL)
 ⁴⁶“So why do you keep calling me ‘Lord, Lord!’ when you don’t do what I say?

### LORD, LORD
This is an important question. But before we break it down, let’s first gather a little bit of context. Who is Jesus talking to? Who is He asking?

We can see that this question is addressed exclusively to the people who call Jesus *Lord, Lord*. But what does it mean?

Now, you probably already know this, but the repetition of the word “Lord” is deliberate. In Hebrew and Aramaic speech, repetition intensifies meaning. In other words:

**Calling Jesus “Lord, Lord” implies:**
* devotion
* loyalty
* belonging
* public confession

Jesus is addressing those who claim to be His devoted, loyal followers. In modern terms, we would say this is about people who go to church on Sundays, who sing during worship, who have all the right answers. They know all the right words. They **LISTEN**, they **HEAR** the WORD. They “follow” Jesus.

Potentially, Jesus could be speaking about me and you. We can all fall into this category, because it is hard to tell real followers from superficial ones.

### THE PROBLEM
The major difference between truly devoted followers and superficially devoted followers is that the latter **do not DO** what Jesus says. They listen, they hear, they “follow” Jesus around, but they **do not do what He says**.

These kinds of people were around Jesus back in the day. They are here tonight. They like the ideas of Jesus; they’re just not into doing things His way.

### TO DO
The word **DO** also means **make**, **produce**. Following Jesus is not merely LISTENING, HEARING, or READING the Word. It’s about applying it. It’s about doing—producing fruit, making a difference. **ACTING UPON IT**

Unfortunately, we live in a world of constant consumption. We’ve trained ourselves to endlessly consume content. We listen to podcasts or sermons nonstop, thinking that this makes us more spiritual, that it makes us better Christians. As soon as we finish one book, podcast, or sermon, we jump to the next one—and then the next one, and so on and so forth.

We like the ideas and the words, but we rarely bother to do the work necessary to internalize that knowledge. We do not act upon it. We do not take the time to practice.

We consume so much and act so little that eventually we become spiritually obese. We say, *"I need this to grow. I do it for my spiritual growth."* But in reality, we consume just for the sake of it—because it feels good. And we want more. We just like it.

<!--NOTE: add more here?-->
We should stop fooling ourselves.

### Difference in worldview
I think this is a real problem. In the modern world, we’ve adopted a “Greek” style of learning, where the highest activity is **theōria**—observation. In the world of **theōria**, the highest goal is understanding, possessing knowledge. Application is not important and is often unnecessary. It is a worldview in which **knowledge is the goal**.

This is how we study in our schools. This is how we study at the university. We spend the first twenty years of our lives mastering the art of **theōria**, gathering knowledge without ever acting upon it. We know so much, but most of the time we don’t really know what to do with all that information. Because in the world of **theoria**, understanding the concept is the goal.

That’s why today someone can consider himself **an expert** after watching a couple of videos on YouTube or reading a book on the topic. I’ve definitely been guilty of that.

### EXAMPLE
[i-know-kung-fu.mp4]
That's exactly me after a weekend of watching youtube.

But then when I get challenged.

[how-did-i-bit-you.mp4]

Do you know who this guy in the black kimono is? It’s life. When you think you’re winning, pulling out your best moves, it crashes you effortlessly. And then it’s like, *"You know how I bit you?"*

Anyway, I don’t know if you noticed, but the young guy is all sweaty and out of breath, while the other one doesn’t even seem to be bothered. Which one do you think took the time to practice what he had learned?

Without realizing it, we take the **theoria** approach and apply it to all spheres of our lives. We listen and watch, watch and listen, or read. And it feels good. It feels like we’re getting better, wiser. We gain more insight, new knowledge, new revelations. It feels like we’re learning something, making progress! When in reality, it’s only an illusion.

### Line
Jesus draws the line in His example

### Luke 6:47
> ⁴⁷ (one who) ...listens to my teaching, and then follows it...

### Luke 6:49
> ⁴⁹ ...the one who has heard and has not acted *accordingly*...

Both types of people came to Jesus. They both heard the word. The difference is that one acted upon it, and the other did not. And for a time, you couldn’t tell the difference—until they experienced pressure. Then it became obvious.

How about you? Which one do you think you are? And I’m not asking which one you *would like* to be—no. Take the time to reflect and see. Not for me. For you.

### Earthquake
How many of you remember the earthquake in Malatya in 2023? A lot of buildings collapsed. You can watch the before-and-after footage on the internet. Some buildings remained untouched, while others turned into piles of brick and cement. One was poorly built; the other was built well.

But you couldn’t tell the difference until they were tested. Then the difference became obvious.

### CONCLUSION
I don’t want us to conform to the culture of this world. I don’t want any of us to be mere consumers, couch experts on faith and Christianity. I want us to be doers, good workers, true followers who **do**, who **make**, who **produce**.

That’s another reason why I didn’t want us to rush into a new book, because we are not after **theoria**. In Romans 12:2, we read:

### Romans 12:2
²And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.

I want each of us to take time to internalize what we’ve learned. To take a sober look at where we place the Word of God in our lives. I know that you all know **"the right answer"**. I don’t want the “right answers.” I want every one of us to look back over the past eight months and see how much our lives have changed because of the book of Romans. What did God reveal to you? Did you put in the effort to act upon it?

The Bible is not meant to be just read. The Bible is meant to be applied directly into our lives.

### Luke 6:46
 ⁴⁶“Now why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?

Is this question if for you?
