### Intro
Last week we are officially finished the book of Romans. Congratulations everyone! It didn't even take us that long. We have started Romans on the first week of May 2025. So, It took us about 8 mounth to go through the whole book. From the beginning to the end. 16 chapters of solid, fundamental truth. Rough calculations will give us speed of 2 chapters per month. Not bad.

And now we at the stage when one can say: *"Ok, we done with Romans. What's next? Where do we go now?"*.

I've thought about it. And you know what? We not going to go anywhere just yet. Because of multiple reasons. One of them being that I would have to leave for few weeks. And we will have guest speakers coming and sharing the word with us. Some of them you know, some of them will be new for you. But they all great, trustworthy people of God. And I'm sure of them that they will bring very good, very healthy and helpful message.

Having that in mind I did not wanted to start a new book. Because  we would have to have a several week break, right after we start.

But also, in the same time, a few weeks ago I had... Maybe we can call it a conviction. A topic come to my mind. Topic that I beleive we should cover. 

And that what we will do today. 

### Sushi
And we will start with a question. **How many of you like Sushi**?


In our family we realized that all of us love Sushi. Even smaller kids, which still surpises me. Unfortunately, we almost never buy them in Batumi, because "oh my gooodness" they are expensive here. And not always that good.

So, what's natural solution in this case? Exactly! "I'll do it myself. What's a big deal to boil some rise and make into roll? Right?" And you turn on a burner, thow a pot on it. Water, rise, vinigar. Bam, bam, bam. I'm looking goood... That's what I've thought.

But very soon you realize that it's not as streightforward as you think it is. My sushi was more like rise blobs with cucamber in it. Total falure.

It took so much effort and the result was... Well, less then I expected. I realized the it takes more then I've though. That having a recepy. Knowing the steps is not enough. That's why when I ran into a documentory about becoming a Sushi chif, I watched it.

### Becoming a chif
Apparantly it is qute a commitement. One enroll into particular "kitchen" as a apprentice. And from there it will take you anywhere from 5 up to 10+ years. You start as a cleaner. Moping floors, doing dishes. Then they trust you to wash rise. And one can just be washing rise for multiple years! Can you imagine?! Then you do some cutting and slicing. Then cooking rise. Then serving. Practicing each step can take multiple years. And most of this years you learn by watching. By imitating. By doing.

### Diffarance
And this approach is so diffarant from the world we life today. Today, after watching couple videos on youtube. One considered an expert. Right? I've definetelly guilty of that. Thinking to myself that I have experties in some area because I watched couple videos online )))

It is because in todays world we adopted "Greek" style of learning. Where the highes activity is **theōria*. Which means **looking at**. In **theoria** world highest goal is understanding, possesing the knowledge. Application is not important and often unnessesery. It is worldview where **knowledge is the goal**.

- "One can know the good without doing it"

This is how we study in our schools. This is how we study in the university. In the modern world we spend first 20 years of our life mastering **theōria**. Which in some sense set's us up for a failure.

Because withough even realizing it, we take this approach and apply it to all spheres of our life. We listen and watch, watch and listen or read. And it feels good. Feels like we getting better, wiser. We get more insight, new knowledge, new revelations. It feels like we learn something, making progress!

### We use same approach
We use same approach when it comes to our faith. Our following Christ. We consider ourselves better christians, because we listen to more sermons. More teaching.

**And I think you should stop**.

...




### John 1:43
 ⁴³...He *found Philip. And Jesus *said to him, “**Follow Me**”

### John 10:27
²⁷My sheep listen to My voice, and I know them, and they **follow Me**;

### Biblical approach

Biblical approach is.




























### Luke 6:46-49
> ⁴⁶“Now why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?

> ⁴⁷Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and acts on them, I will show you whom he is like:⁴⁸he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock; and when there was a flood, the river burst against that house and *yet* it could not shake it, because it had been well built.⁴⁹But the one who has heard and has not acted *accordingly* is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation; and the river burst against it and it immediately collapsed, and the ruin of that house was great.”

This scripture is the very end of so colled *Sermon on the Mauntain*. Which is basically an outline of how we should live. It is very practical. It's probobly the most famous. Maybe even the most important sermon of Jesus. Definetely it's one of the most qoted pices of scriptures. And considered to be **the core** of christian living.

All that to say "It's extremely important". So, we better pay attention to what it says. I want us to have a closer look at verse 46:

### Luke 6:46
> ⁴⁶“Now why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?

In modern translation it sounds like:

### Luke 6:46(NTL)
 ⁴⁶“So why do you keep calling me ‘Lord, Lord!’ when you don’t do what I say?

### LORD, LORD
This is important question. But before we will break it down. First let's gather a little bit of a context. Who Jesus is talking to? Who He is asking?

We can see that this question addressed exclusively to the people, who call Jesus *Lord, Lord*. What is that mean?

Now, you probobly alreayd know this, but repetition of the word "Lord" is deliberate. In Hebrew and Aramaic speech, repetition intensifies meaning. In other words.

**Calling Jesus “Lord, Lord” implies:**
* devotion
* loyalty
* belonging
* public confession

Jesus addresses those who claim to be His devoted, loyal followers. In the modern turms we would say. It it people who go to church on Sundays. Who sing during worship. Have all the right answers. They know all the right words. They **LISTEN**, they **HEAR** the WORD. They follow Jesus.

Potentially Jesus speaks about me and you. We all fall into this category.

### THE PROBLEM
The major differance between truly devoted followers and superficially devoted followers. Is that the other onces **do not DO** what Jesus say. They listen, they hear, they follow Jesus around. But they do not do what he say.

The word **DO** also means **make**, **produce**. Following is not merely LISTENING, HEARING or READING the word. It's appying. It is doing, producing, making.

### Luke 6:47
> ⁴⁷I will show you what it’s like when someone comes to me, listens to my teaching, and then follows it.

### Luke 6:49
> ⁴⁹But the one who has heard and has not acted *accordingly* is like a man who...

The both types of people they came, they have listened to the teaching. The diffarance is that one acted opon it and the other did not. As we read illustration we see that for a while diffarance was not apparant. Until the troubles come. Then it became obvious.

Do you remember earthqake in Malatia in 2023?














### Hunger. Good food vs Bad food
Ideas that you hear they sound fake. They sound like someone elses words. 
After a while you just can tell that, someone got hooked up. It shows in their vocabulary, in their phrasing. 


Maybe we start right. We lack knowledge, or wisdom and we start the search. But then, before we know we, it turns into recreational consumtion. We actually already found the answer. But we 


We missing fundamental step. Practicing. You can't truly know something, unless you master it by repeated practice. All the pro's go back to fundamentals all the time. But every time they do, they uncover new side of it. In pretty much any craft. 

We stopped internelizing information. We offloaded our critical thinking. And that's what the world want's you

### Exams
I wanted us to reflect yet again. Re-evaluate where do we place bible, the word of God in our life? And I know that we all know **"the right answer"**. But, I don't want you to tell me the right answer. I want you to look back over the last 8 mounth. And to see, how much your life changed due to the studiyng book of Romans. 

We can say that we just finished a comprehensive unit in the school of God. And time have come for the evaluation.

Bible is not ment to be just read. Bible ment to be applied directly into our lifes. But let's be honest with ourselves How much biblical influence do we allow in our life?

### Romans 12:2
²And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.



### This makes discipleship existential, not academic.



### James 1:22-25
²²But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not just hearers who deceive themselves.²³For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror;²⁴for *once* he has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was.²⁵But one who has looked intently at the perfect law, the *law* of freedom, and has continued *in it,* not having become a forgetful hearer but an active doer, this person will be blessed in what he does.

### James 1:22-25
 ²²But don’t just listen to God’s word. You must do what it says. Otherwise, you are only fooling yourselves.²³For if you listen to the word and don’t obey, it is like glancing at your face in a mirror.²⁴You see yourself, walk away, and forget what you look like.²⁵But if you look carefully into the perfect law that sets you free, and if you do what it says and don’t forget what you heard, then God will bless you for doing it.


### Matthew 7:24-27
 ²⁴“Therefore, everyone who hears these words of Mine, and acts on them, will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.²⁵And the rain fell and thefloods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and *yet* it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.²⁶And everyone who hears these words of Mine, and does notact on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.²⁷And the rain fell and thefloods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell—and its collapse was great.”


### Luke 6:46-49
 ⁴⁶“Now why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?⁴⁷Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and acts on them, I will show you whom he is like:⁴⁸he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock; and when there was a flood, the river burst against that house and *yet* it could not shake it, because it had been well built.⁴⁹But the one who has heard and has not acted *accordingly* is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation; and the river burst against it and it immediately collapsed, and the ruin of that house was great.”
