# Inductive Bible Study Method (Calvary Chapel Style)

The Inductive Bible Study Method involves three main steps:

---

## 🟥 1. Observation — *What does the text say?*

Focus: Careful examination of the passage without interpretation.

**Key Tasks:**
- Read the passage carefully and repeatedly.
- Identify:
  - **Who** is involved?
  - **What** is happening?
  - **Where** is it taking place?
  - **When** is it happening?
  - **How** is it described?
- Look for:
  - Keywords and repeated phrases
  - Commands, promises, contrasts, comparisons
  - Cause-and-effect relationships
  - Literary structure

**Question to ask:**  
*What is the plain and obvious meaning of the text?*

---

## 🟧 2. Interpretation — *What does the text mean?*

Focus: Understanding the intended meaning in its original context.

**Key Principles:**
- **Context is king** — interpret within:
  - The verse
  - The paragraph
  - The chapter
  - The book
  - The whole Bible
- **Scripture interprets Scripture** — use cross-references.
- Consider:
  - The author’s intent
  - The audience’s situation
  - Historical and cultural background
  - Word meanings in the original language (Greek/Hebrew)

**Question to ask:**  
*What was God saying to the original audience?*

---

## 🟩 3. Application — *What does the text mean for me?*

Focus: Responding to the truth with obedience and transformation.

**Key Reflections:**
- Is there a **command to obey**?
- A **sin to avoid or confess**?
- A **promise to claim**?
- An **example to follow or avoid**?
- A **truth about God** to believe or worship?
- A **step of faith** to take?

**Question to ask:**  
*How should this truth change my thinking, actions, or heart?*

## ✝️ Calvary Chapel Emphasis

- Verse-by-verse **expositional teaching**
- Letting the **Bible speak for itself**
- Avoiding over-spiritualizing or allegorizing
- Dependence on the **Holy Spirit** for interpretation
- Goal: **Transformation**, not just information
