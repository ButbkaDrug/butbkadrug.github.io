### Romans 8:23-39
²³And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.²⁴For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees?²⁵But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.

 ²⁶Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.²⁷And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because  the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.²⁸And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good,  for those who are called according to his purpose.²⁹For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.³⁰And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.

 ³¹What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be  against us?³² He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?³³Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies.³⁴ Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died — more than that, who was raised — who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us.³⁵Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?³⁶As it is written, 

“For your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.”

 ³⁷No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.³⁸For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,³⁹nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
