{{<stopwatch>}}

Today we are finishing chapter 8 of the book of Romans. We are pretty much right in the middle of the letter. Today we going to continue to talk about hardships and sufferings a little bit more. Last Sunday Matt gave us a good start and we are about to pick up where we left it. But before we will do that I would like to briefly go over things that we already learned so far.

Going through the book of Romans we are exploring some very important truth about our life as followers of Christ. We are **solidifying** or **reinforcing** the foundation of our life so to speak. We are deepening our roots in the Lord. Which is very important life long process. That insures that even in the middle of the worst storms we have something to cling to. That no matter how hard the storm is it will not be able to root us out.

We learned that all people are guilty of sin. It is universal problem for every single one of us regardless of our nation, level of well being or social status. We learned that justification comes by faith in Jesus Christ and it is not something that anyone can earn. It is the result of God's grace. We also learned that abundance of God's grace is not a license to sin. We die to sin and raise for newness of life when we get baptized into Christ Jesus. But being born again is not the end goal. It's not the final destination, as some might think. No, it's more of a starting point where our race begin.

And in the chapter 7th Paul start to explain to us that the hardships and difficulties, troubles and confrontation is a normal part of our life as a Christian. When we face difficulties it doesn't mean that God is not with us. It doesn't mean that we were not born again or have no faith. As some people actually state.

We still live in a broken world. We live in a world that apposes God and everyone of God. We live in our mortal bodies. Which are still imperfect and susceptible to a temptations and decease. Last week we talked how all creation is groaning and we ourselves groan waiting for God's kingdom to come in full. The battle is not over for us, not yet. We find ourselves in the mids of storm time to time. And it is ok.

Sometimes we find ourselves strong and capable. But other times it catches us "*off guard*". Life kicks us when we are already down.

I don't know if you ever find yourself in a position when you are so crushed that you can't even get a word out. Your completely wiped out. You can't pray, can't cry, can't hope. You just sit and stair into oblivion.

Some uber spiritual people will say it never happens if you a real one, but I will dare to say it does. Bible doesn't say that we will never be down. What it actually promise is that we will never be alone. 

### Romans 8:26,27
>²⁶Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.²⁷And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because  the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.

The good news it that Holy Spirit, that lives in us, helps us in our weakness.

The Greek word "ἀσθένεια" (astheneia) - comes from "ἀ" (a = without) + "σθένος" (sthenos = strength), so it literally means "without strength".

Spirit of God helps us when we are without strength. God doesn't sit on his throne watching us struggle and then crossing out our name saying *"oh, well... oh, well... that one was not strong enough"*. No, God is loving father. God is on our side. And when we fall short. When we don't even know what to pray for. When we can't even tell would be God's will in the situations and how to pray.  Spirit of God himself intercedes for us.

If you find yourself at the point of astheneia or "*no strength*". It doesn't meant that you are a bad Christian. That you didn't read you bible enough. You didn't fasted enough. You didn't pray enough. It doesn't meant that God is angry with you. But God is there, with you. As Spirit intercede for you, on your behalf.

And unlike us, Spirit always know how to pray. Spirit knows our heart and knows the will of God for the concrete situation. As verse 27 indicates. And it doesn't matter weather our weakness has physical, emotional, spiritual or intellectual nature Spirit of God, that lives in us, still understands what we feel and what we need. 

"Bad Things Happen To Good People" it a common phrase. And there is even a book under the same name. And more often then not bad things and decease  is not the consequences of good people's  sin, lack faith, or perhaps they were not even born again in the first place. It's much simpler that that. It is because we still live in the broken world and not everything that happens to us is good. But God can turn all things to work together for good, for those who love Him.

### Romans 8:28-30
²⁸And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.²⁹For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.³⁰And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.

>³¹What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be  against us?³² He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?³³Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies.³⁴ Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died — more than that, who was raised — who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us.³⁵Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?³⁶As it is written, 

>“For your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.”

>³⁷No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.³⁸For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,³⁹nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
