### Intro
Today we gonna go over Romans 9. And this chapter starts a new theme. Rises the issue,that will inevitably stand out if you think about it for a moment. Out today's passage is a part of a bigger picture. Chapters 9, 10 and 11 are all take about role of the people of Israel in the God's plan. And even though there is not too many Israelites among us right now, there is something for us to learn. So, prepare your heart, because God will speak to you tonight. And let's start reading:


### Romans 9:1-5
>¹ I am speaking the truth in Christ — I am not lying; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit —²that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.³For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers,  my kinsmen according to the flesh.⁴They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises.⁵To them belong the patriarchs, and from their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen.

#### Paul prepares his audience
In this section of the letter to the church in Rome. Paul mainly speak to a Jewish part of the congregation. You will notice the language that he uses, examples that he brings are exclusively form the old testament. All those things that didn't make much sense for Gentile followers. But bore great value and meaning for the Jewish part of the church.

Right of the bat Paul insures that he is not biased against Jews. You might expect that to be the case, considering that most of the suffering and troubles Paul went through, were caused by them, his own people. And Jews themself would often accuse Paul. That he works against Israelites.

But no, Paul love his people. Who also God's chosen people as well. In the verses 1 - 5 Paul prepares the ground because what he will say next might be difficult to hear.

### Question
It seem like the rest of the chapter contains and an answer, but question itself seems to be missing. When you start reading verse 6 it kinda jumps at you. So, before we will read further, let me ask you a question. Did you ever considered how many Jews actually follow Jesus? I didn't until this week. I started to read and got to verse 6. Then I realize that the missing question is why is the Jews do not follow Jesus. Why they don't come to salvation? I didn't do a proper research, but even the overview is quite shocking. My first finding was that only 0.4% Jews consider themselves followers of Christ. It is extremely small number. Later I searched some more and if we look globally it is a bit better. It will be more like 2.5%. But it's shockingly small.

Because we are not talking about some people group who never heard the Gospel. You know, some distant, hard to reach tribe. No, we talking about God's special people. People to whom Jesus witnessed himself!

With this statics in mind, the question arises "Is the word or God has failed?". Because, you know, it is the most logical explanation. Or at least that's the first thing that comes to mind. What does the bible says?

### Romans 9:6-13
>⁶But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel,⁷and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring, but “Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.”⁸This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as offspring.⁹For this is what the promise said: “About this time next year I will return, and Sarah shall have a son.”¹⁰And not only so, but also when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac,¹¹though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad — in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of him who calls —¹²she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”¹³As it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”


### Election
I told you that Paul will use a lot of references to an old testament stories! Here we go. Doing my preparation I could really relate to the believers of non Jewish background who listened to Paul's letter. I myself had to go and look up this stories to get the context and so on. And I have free access to and Old Testament and all kids of tools that help me to find what I am looking for. But many of the original receivers didn't even have access to that information. So, you can appreciate ease of access that you have to the bible right now.

There is few important things going on. Let's brake some of them down.

### Not all who was born Jew is chosen by God
First and the most radical claim that Paul makes is that not all who was born Jew should be considered children of God. It was very controversial statement. Because it went against traditional views. And Paul supports his argument with 2 stories from old testament. Story of Abraham and story of Isaac. 

And in both stories man would have more that one child. And God would chose one of them for his divine purpose. Not only that, but God doesn't chose firstborn. This is something that was expected. But in both stories it was younger brother who got elected. Which was completely unfair and unheard of in the context of the culture. God's choice is completely sovereign.

### It's not about individuals
Please, note that in both of the stories we are NOT talking about individuals and their destiny. But, we are talking about nations that descended from them. And also at this point we not talking about the salvation in any capacity. We talk about God's choices of people for fulfillment of His plan of delivering salvation to people.

### Severing choice
We can see that thought the history God makes sovereign choices as today's scripture points out. He choices people groups and sometimes individuals for His special GOOD purposes, for His work. God's chose before any kind of actions on the human part. Therefore you cannot "earn" or be "owed" that choice. He just know the right person for the mission.

What Paul is saying is that though they are Jews. Not all of them are God's children. Which was insane statement to make. They always was God's special people. How come they are not part of this promise? Why Gentiles getting saved in bulk. With getting Holy Spirit and so on. But not so much Israelites?

### Romans 9:14-18
>¹⁴What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God's part? By no means!¹⁵For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”¹⁶So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy.¹⁷For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”¹⁸So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills.

### Injustice <!--FIX: Israel should have been first and more important. But now Gentiles taking a lead -->
And Paul foresees reaction of his readers. "It is unfair, that not all Israelites are chosen by God". Again he goes back to Old Testament to state that it not injustice but actually act of mercy. The story that Paul reminds them us, is the story when Jews made a golden calf and started to worship him while Moses was on the mountain with God. And God wanted to destroy all of them. They broke the covenant and by justice, they deserved destruction. But God decides to forgave some and judged the others.

They all was supposed to be destroyed. But God forgave some. We should not forget that God doesn't owe us anything. He doesn't owe us kindness,  he doesn't owe us blessings, he doesn't own us healing ither. It is by His sovereign choice he decides to have mercy on some.

### Hardening
Here comes the challenging part of today chapter. It's easier for us to accept God's divine and sovereign right to show mercy on whomever he wills. But not so much with hardening of hearts. When we read verse 18:

### Romans 9:18
>¹⁸So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills.

It just sounds wrong. Sounds unfair. It brings up uneasy questions. Does God interferes my free will? Some other people come to conclusion that there is no such thing as a free will then. It is all about God's desire. And will of the man plays no role what so ever. Beyond something what to cook for the breakfast. We take this verse and immediately apply it to the matter of salvation. And we come to conclusions that our logic suggests.

But today I want you to step back. And take another perspective.

### Examples of Old Testament
Let's take a look on the examples that are in the bible. And there aren't too many. Paul refers to the most well known story with a Pharaoh. When Israelites were slaves in Egypt and Pharaoh didn't let them go. We all know the story. When God hardens the heart of Pharaoh. And then sends the plagues. Until Pharaoh let Israelites go.

We will leave the actual story aside. But if you imagine that Pharaoh was just a great guy, salt of the earth, top shelf, Grade-A human. Who would let Israelites go on problem. As soon as they ask. No. He and His Father was the reason Jews started to cry out to God in the first place. Because life as slaves became unbearable. Bible mentions that **Pharaoh** harden his heart several times. He did his part of hardening too. It was not purely the influence of the divine.

There is few other mentions in the Old Testament. And none of them. Including the story with Pharaoh are connected to once salvation. In every occasion it is about God "steering the sheep", so to speak. Fulfilling His plan of delivering salvation to people. And to the best of my knowledge God influenced kings or overlords, "*Man in power*" in order to direct Israelites. It was not about regular people lives and decisions. 

### NT Examples
There is however mention of hardening of heart in the New Testament too. And every time they are about the same thing. It's not a surprise for anyone because even prophet Isaiah spoke about it well before it actually happen. And that is hardening of the hearts of Jews towards the Gospel.

And if you look into it. You will see that it is divine justice. It is the result of hundreds of years of rebel against God. Ignoring Gods word. Persecuting God's prophets. Generations of being stiffed necks. God warned Israelites about it. They did their hundreds of years of hardening of their hearts. And now they rip the harvest of that behaviour.

So, I want you to remember this:
Even when we face mentions of hardening of the heart. It is never arbitrary. Never random. Never for no reason. And I will risk to says that except for the cases or rather biblically only one case of divine punishment over the entire nation. It is never about the matter of salvation.

### Application
So if today you are in the situation when your loved ones, your close ones, people dear to your heart are not with the Lord yet. Or they stepping away from the Lord. Don't give up. Don't think in categories "maybe God hardens their heart or they are not divinely elected". No. God want all people to be saved and come to the knowledge of truth. Don't give up. Don't loose hope.

Remember that God is with us. He is loving Father. 






































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































 <!--NOTE: Is the God Unjust?-->
 ¹⁴What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God's part? By no means!¹⁵For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”¹⁶So then it depends not on human will or exertion,  but on God, who has mercy.¹⁷For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”¹⁸So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills.

 <!--NOTE: He again speaking for Gentiles. And as much as he hates it against Jews?-->
 ¹⁹You will say to me then, “Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?”²⁰But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, “Why have you made me like this?”²¹ Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use?²²What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,²³in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory —²⁴even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles?²⁵As indeed he says in Hosea, 

“Those who were not my people I will call ‘my people,’ and her who was not beloved I will call ‘beloved.’”²⁶ “And in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ there they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’”

 ²⁷And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: “Though the number of the sons of Israel  be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will be saved,²⁸for the Lord will carry out his sentence upon the earth fully and without delay.”²⁹And as Isaiah predicted, 

 “If the Lord of hosts had not left us offspring, we would have been like Sodom and become like Gomorrah.”

 ³⁰What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith;³¹but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness  did not succeed in reaching that law.³²Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone,³³as it is written, 

“Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense; and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.”
