> ### Romans 6:15-23
>¹⁵What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!¹⁶Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves,  you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?¹⁷But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed,¹⁸and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness.¹⁹ I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.

>²⁰ For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.²¹ But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.²²But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life.²³ For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.


### Intro

We continue our conversation about God's grace in relation to our day to day life. Last Sunday we explored that **abundance of God's grace is not a licence to sin**. The fact that God's grace can cover any multitude of sin does not mean that we allowed to sin as much as we wish. But, rather otherwise we should consider ourselves dead to sin, in order to raise for new life for God, in Jesus. We said that you cannot be resurrected if you  haven't died yet. And our baptism symbolized our death to sin. We live in the new reality which described in verse 14

### Romans 6:14
¹⁴...For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.

I feel like this important statement is one of those that often being misused to justify the lifestyle that does not align with the scriptures.

You ask a couple that claim to be devoted follower of Christ:
> "Hey, why do you live together and do not get married?"
And the response you get:
> "It's OK. We're not under the law, but under the grace"

Hopefully today we will see that this is not how this passage works. We should remember that when taken out of the context scriptures can be used to justify pretty much anything. People twist the bible to fit their view of life instead of letting God change their way of thinking.

### COME UP WITH A GOOD NAME FOR THE SECTION))
I like to approach studying the bible same as you approach painting. First, it's all about preparation. And Second, every new coat should overlap previous one around 50%. It's not like I'm doing it intentionally, it's just happening. So, we will start at the end of our previous scripture.

Verse 14 says that we are not under the law, but under the grace. But what does it actually means?
