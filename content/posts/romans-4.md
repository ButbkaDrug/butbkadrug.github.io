We are continue to talk about justification and faith. And today we will go over the case of Abraham.

## Why Abraham
Why Abraham? Well, I think it is fare to say that with Abraham begins the story of "God's special people". Abraham is a key, he is forefather of Jews. And he considered a forefather of all who believes God. We can find the story of Abraham right in the beginning of the bible in the book of Genesis chapter 12. It's basically right at the start. Rough timeline would look like this: Noah came out of the Arc and God promised to never flood the earth again. Then approximately 100-200 years later there were story of the Babilon's tower where people revolted against God once again. And then around 300 years after the flood Abraham was born.

### Fun Fact
>Little fun fact is that Noah were still alive when Abraham was born. Noah died when Abraham was in his fifties.

God speaks to Abraham in chapter 12. Promising some really amazing things. With the foundational requirement of **faith expressed through obedience**.

Abraham makes this step of faith. He believes God and it changes the course of the history forever. He was 75 years old at the time when he started his journey. His faith was put to the test big time more then once. And he passed every time. He was not a perfect person by any means, He had his share of mistakes that he made along the way. But he is an amazing example of faith and faithfulness to God. He is a key figure in the history of God's special people. A lot of people believed that they will be justified because they are descendants of Abraham. For example when people have come to John the baptist to get baptized he warned them:

### Luke 3:8
>⁸Bear fruits in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.

It was one of the main teachings and quite common believe that justification comes through genealogical belonging. "We are justified because of Abraham. Because we are his descendants". Actually common belief was even more radical(at least from our point of view). That God ONLY concerned with Abraham descendants. That he is God of Jews only.

But at the end of the chapter 3 we read this verses:

### Romans 3:29,30
²⁹Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,³⁰since God is one — who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.

We know that God is one and there is no other Gods. Paul brings us to conclusion that God  does not belong and He is not limited by any specific people group. He is God of **ALL** people. He love all people all the same, he judges all people all the same and justifies all people all the same. Though faith.

Which leads to a very reasonable question:

### Romans 4:1-25
>¹What then shall we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh? ²For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. ³For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.” ⁴Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due. ⁵And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness, ⁶just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:

>⁷ “Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; ⁸blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin.”

>⁹Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness.¹⁰How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised.¹¹ He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well,¹²and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.

>¹³For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith.¹⁴ For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void.¹⁵For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression.

>¹⁶That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring — not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,¹⁷as it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations” — in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist.¹⁸In hope he believed against hope, that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been told, “So shall your offspring be.”¹⁹He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness  of Sarah's womb.²⁰No unbelief made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God,²¹fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.²²That is why his faith was “counted to him as righteousness.”²³But the words “it was counted to him” were not written for his sake alone,²⁴but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord,²⁵ who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.
