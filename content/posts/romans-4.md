We are continue to talk about "new" approach to justification and faith. And today we will talk about Abraham.

## Why Abraham
Why Abraham? Well, I think it is fare to say that with Abraham begins the story of "God's special people". Abraham is a key, he is forefather of Jews. And he considered a forefather of all who believes God. We can find the story of Abraham right in the beginning of the bible in the book of Genesis chapter 12. It's basically at the very start. Rough timeline would look like this: Noah came out of the Arc and God promised to never flood the earth again. Then approximately 100-200 years later there were story of the Babilon's tower where people revolted against God once again. And then around 300 years after the flood Abraham was born.

### Fun Fact
>Little fun fact is that Noah were still alive when Abraham was born. Noah died when Abraham was in his fifties.

But, anyway. God speaks to Abraham in chapter 12. Promising some really amazing things. With effectively one foundational requirement of **faith expressed through obedience**.

Abraham makes this step of faith. He believes God and it changes the course of the history forever. He was 75 years old at the time when he started his journey. His faith was put to the test big time more then once. And he passed every time. He was not a perfect person by any means, He had his share of mistakes that he made along the way. But he is an amazing example of faith and faithfulness to God. He is a key figure and quite literally forefather of God's special people. A lot of Jews believed that they will be justified because they are descendants of Abraham. For example when people have come to John the baptist to get baptized John warned them:

### Luke 3:8
>⁸Bear fruits in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.

It was one of the main teachings and quite common believe that justification comes through genealogical belonging. "We are justified because of Abraham. Because we are his descendants". Actually common belief was even more radical(at least from our point of view). That God ONLY concerned with Abraham and his descendants. That he is God of Jews only.

But at the end of the chapter 3 we read this verses:

### Romans 3:29,30
²⁹Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,³⁰since God is one — who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.

We know that God is one and there is no other Gods. Paul brings us to conclusion that God  does not belong to any specific group of people and He is not limited by any specific people group. He is God of **ALL** people. He love all people all the same, he judges all people all the same and justifies all people all the same. Though faith.

Which leads to a very reasonable question:

### Romans 4:1-12
>¹What then shall we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh? ²For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. ³For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.” ⁴Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due. ⁵And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness, ⁶just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:

>⁷ “Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; ⁸blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin.”

>⁹Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness.¹⁰How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised.¹¹ He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well,¹²and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.

Let's stop here for a moment and think about what we just read.

Paul says that even patriarch Abraham does not have any works to boast about before God. God reviles the very reason why Abraham were considered righteous.

>"**Abraham believed** God and it was counted to him as righteousness"

His faith was the thing that set him apart. It is about believing God and not about works. King David another noticeable biblical figure confirms that:

### Romans 4:7,8
 ⁷ “Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;⁸blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin.”

All this blessings are promised. They are **blessings** because you cannot earn them. It that would be possible, it would not be a blessing, but merely a pay or due. You know, when you work a job, at the end of the month you don't need to hope for your pay check(at least in theory). Your employer owes you that money. You earned it, they are yours. 

But you cannot earn Gods forgiveness or justification. It is simply impossible. You can only receive it as a gift, as a blessing. No one ever earned justification. Not even Abraham. And all the laws and circumcision and the rest came later. They came after he believed. **Faith that expressed though obedience** - that were it's at.

### Romans 4:13-15
>¹³For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith.¹⁴ For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void.¹⁵For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression.

You see if only those who fulfill the law would be heir of the world then it is not a promise or the blessing anymore. It is due. Then you do not need to believe, then you own the thing. But the only thing you can get by relaying on the law is wrath. This is the only pay you'll get because we as humans simply not capable to adhere to God's standard of righteousness. And the only way out of it, is not to go that route. Do not rely on your works, they not gonna justify you before God.

### Romans 4:16-25
>¹⁶That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring — not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,¹⁷as it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations” — in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist.¹⁸In hope he believed against hope, that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been told, “So shall your offspring be.”¹⁹He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness  of Sarah's womb.²⁰No unbelief made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God,²¹fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.²²That is why his faith was “counted to him as righteousness.”²³But the words “it was counted to him” were not written for his sake alone,²⁴but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord,²⁵ who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.

God knew that we cannot earn forgiveness and justification that's why He made those a **promise** that rest on grace. In this way it is guaranteed to all of us. You do not earn something that has been promised. You receive it by grace. Today all of us who believed God. Who have **faith that expressed though obedience**. We all are descendants of Abraham, his offspring. We all are fulfillment of God's promise. And today we are share in all the promises that God made to his people because of Abraham's faith.

He was the person who believed against odds. The were no odds on his side. The facts of life were against him. But he believed never the less. He believed God that he can do impossible. He believed AND acted upon it. That's why today I keep repeating that it is about **faith that expressed through obedience**. Our faith should be living faith. It should do something. 


So, what do we learned today:

We learned that no one get's justified by his works. Not even Abraham, forefather of all who follow God.
We learned that justification and forgiveness are the blessings that are promised and guaranteed by Gods grace. They can be received by **faith expressed in obedience**. 
We learned that we also considered descendants of Abraham, and we can count on all the blessings of the bible, without having to be circumcised and follow Mosaic law. As long as we walk in the footsteps of the faith as Abraham.
And moreover none who rely on mere following the law and circumcision will be justified before God.

Abraham believed in the words that God spoke to him. Into the primes that God gave to Him, and his faith were counted as righteousness. Today God made a promise to all human beings. Who will have faith in Jesus Christ will be saved, will be justified. This is the promise that we need to stand by today. **Faith in Jesus Christ that will be expressed in obedience to him.**
