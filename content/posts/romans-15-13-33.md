### INTRO
Last week we started with chapter 15. Brother Andrey shared with us about importance of bearing with each others. I think it is very relevant to any church, but especially for our church. Because, our Church is a lot like early Christians in Rome. Look around the room, see we represent big variety of people. Who come from the different countries, different cultural and church backgrounds. Somehow each of us end up staying in Batumi joining Calvary Chapel Church family.

### Not Empty Handed
When we join the church. We don't come empty handed. We carry the load of our previous experiences. Our mindset, our local culture, our church culture. Sometimes it is obvious and we well aware of our differences. And sometimes we not aware those differences exist. They remain unknown knows. 

### EXAMPLE - Paul's Mashed Potatoes
In 6 month time it will be 10 years since We as a family moved to Batumi. And many of you know that. What many of you don't know is that before coming to Georgia, we spend over 5 years working with YWAM in Armenia.

We have good friends there, fellow missionaries. We served together a lot and spent a lot of evenings together as well. During one of such evening we were cooking something after a big day full of ministris. It was regular night, nothing was special about it. But, I was yet to know that this evening my whole world will turn upsidwon.

My friend Paul, American guy, was making mashed potatos. He was working on it for a few minutes and I went to the kitchen to help him out. I'm from Belarus originally and we know how to handle potatoes there, trust me. Potatoes are big part of our life in Belarus.

I'm walking into a small kitchen. Of an old soviet apartment. Everyghing is old here. Old wals, old cabinets, old stove. No rangehood, bad ventelation. Classic... Kitchen is very damp and filled with steam from... wait what?

Boilig water? Wait...

I look at Paul. He is right next to the stove with a basket of unpeeled potatos. I watch Him as he peels a potato. Then he turns. And slices it streight away, right into a boiling water. In the thinest slices possible.

My whole being was screaming at this abomination! Everything he did was wrong! I could not even beleive what I just saw. The very foundations of my existence trembled beneath me.

I was ready shout "STOOOOOOOP! You doing it wrong!"

...

### LESSON
The mashed potatoes turned out surprisingly good — but that night, I learned something far more important. I realized I’m full of unknown knowns: the hidden beliefs, the quiet habits, the invisible lenses through which I see the world. They shape me, guide me, whisper to me… and yet I move through life unaware they even exist.

...

### CONNECTION
When we gather together, as we getting closer and open up. As we work together. This hidden beliefs and quiet habits clash. They can create tensions, misunderstanding, conflicts. We need to stay alert. We need to learn to bear with one another. We need to learn to understand to love and accept one another.

### WHY?
**Why**?

Because, this is the will of God for you.

...

So easy. God wants you to live and grow in love. This is the life of worship in a nutshell. This is all God wants you to do. That's all!

### Hard Part
The concept is super easy. It's so accessible that anyone can understand this. The hard part is application. Going from theory to practice. And that's where we need help. That's were we need one another. That's when church fellowship comes into play.

### Romans 15:14-16
>¹⁴And concerning you, my brothers *and sisters,* I myself also am convinced that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able also to admonish one another.¹⁵But I have written very boldly to you on some points so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given to me from God,¹⁶to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, so that *my* offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.

### Admonish
Verse 14 is the key to why it is so important to be a part of the church family. To be present, to belong, to submit to a very concrete local church. Withing the context of the local church, we will be able to fulfill the will of God. Through his church God will help us to become people after his own heart. To find our calling and to fulfill it. He will help us to be the people we were created to be.

### Safe environment
Church becomes a safe environment where we can grow spiritually, where we can grow our character. Withing the church family we are able to live in God's kingdom right now. It is the place where transformation begins.

When I was a teenager. I was fascinated with computer games. I would spend day and night in my room playing. Especially during school break. For me the game became the way to escape reality. Reality of dysfunctional family, of all the distress that were happening in my home. I would immerse myself into the game. Into the world where I can become a mighty warrior. Skilled archer or unbeatable swordsman. Fulfilling an important missions. Saving villages and entire continents.

It felt so great. It was a whole new world. World that I liked so much. It would let me to forget about the burdensome reality for a time being.

But, I could not stay there. Sooner of later I had to come back to the real world. And all my progress, all my achievements and skills that I learned remained there, in the game. None of them translated into this world. I was as useless and unskilled as before I sat down to play.

The game was my secret world. Were I would escape my troubles, issues, things I have to deal with. World were I can start form a blank page. But this wold was imaginary. It will never come to life. But I craved for this outlet. Safe place were I can escape troubles of my life, and not to be me.

...

A bit later our local church became such place for me in the real world. Coming to church was a bit like immersing into a different world. World that operated under different rules and standards. World where I started to change my character, pick up skills. And those changes stayed with me when I would have to leave the church and go back home. Go back to the reality of my life.

The game offered me fake reality. With fake progress. Fake feeling of achievements.

Whereas in the church I could grow for real.

...

This is what we are called to be. To be a gateway into the kingdom of God. To be a place that is safe, full of goodness. Place were we can admonish one another.

Admonish means:

* To gently warn someone

* To correct them in a kind, caring way

* To encourage someone to do what is right

* To point out a problem or mistake so they can grow

And to do that

>¹⁴And concerning you, my brothers *and sisters,* I myself also am convinced that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able also to admonish one another.¹⁵But I have written very boldly to you on some points so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given to me from God,¹⁶to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, so that *my* offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.



### Healthy church is able to carry out it's role. but not every church is health


Paul had God given authority to that was indisputable. You cannot jump in and start teaching and giving advice and etc. 

### Romans 15:17-33
¹⁷Therefore in Christ Jesus I have found reason for boasting in things pertaining to God.¹⁸For I will not presume to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me, resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed,¹⁹in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit; so that from Jerusalem and all around as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.²⁰And in this way I aspired to preach the gospel, not where Christ was *already* known by name, so that I would not build on another person’s foundation;²¹but just as it is written: 

>“THEY WHO HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD ABOUT HIM WILL SEE, AND THEY WHO HAVE NOT HEARD WILL UNDERSTAND.”

>²²For this reason I have often been prevented from coming to you;²³but now, with no further place for me in these regions, and since I have had for many years a longing to come to you²⁴whenever I go to Spain—for I hope to see you in passing, and to be helped on my way there by you, when I have first enjoyed your company for a while—²⁵but now, I am going to Jerusalem, serving the saints.²⁶For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.²⁷For they were pleased *to do so,* and they are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they are indebted to do them a service also in material things.²⁸Therefore, when I have finished this, and have put my seal on this fruit of theirs, I will go on by way of you to Spain.²⁹I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.

>³⁰Now I urge you, brothers *and sisters,* by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,³¹that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea, and *that* my service for Jerusalem may prove acceptable to the saints;³²so that I may come to you in joy by the will of God and relax in your company.³³Now the God of peace *be* with you all. Amen.
