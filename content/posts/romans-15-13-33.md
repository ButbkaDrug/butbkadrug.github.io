### INTRO
Last week we started with chapter 15. Brother Andrey shared with us about importants of bearing with each others little thingsis. I think it is very releveant to our church. Because, we are alot like early christians in Rome in many ways. If you would look around the room. You would see big veraety of people. We came from different countries, different cultural and church backgrounds. One way or the other we end up staying in Batumi. And we end up joining Calvary Chapel Church family.

But we did not come empty handed. We carry the load of our previous expirinces. Our phisical and spiritual upbringing. Our local culture, our church culture. Sometimes it is obvious and we well aware of our differences. And sometimes we not aware those differences exist. They remain unknown knows. And inevitably it creates friction between us.

Let me share with you a story.

### EXAMPLE - Paul's Mashed Potatoes
In 6 month time it will be 10 years since We as a family moved to Batumi. And many of you know that. What you don't know is that before coming to Georgia, we spend over 5 years working with YWAM in Armenia.

We have good friends there Paul and Lena. We served together a lot and spent a lot of evenings together as well. During one of such evening we were cooking something after a big day full of ministris. It was regular night, nothing was special about it. But, I was yet to know that this evening my whole world will turn upsidwon.

My friend Paul, american guy, was making mashed potatos. He was working on it for a few minutes and I went to the kitchen to help him out. I'm from Belarus originally and we know how to handle potatoes there, trust me.

I'm walking into a small kitchen. Everyghing is old here. Old wals, old cabinets, old stove. No rangehood, bad ventelation. Kitchen is very damp and filled with steam from... wait what?

Boilig water? Wait...

I look at Paul. He is right next to the stove with a basket of unpeeled potatos. I watch Him peels a potato. Then he turn. And slice it streight away, right into a boiling water. In the thinest slices possible.

My whole being was screaming at this abomination! Everything he did was wrong! I could not even beleive what I just saw. The very foundations of my existence trembled beneath me.

I was ready shout "STOOOOOOOP! You doing it wrong!"

...

The mashed potatoes turned out surprisingly good — but that night, I learned something far more important. I realized I’m full of unknown knowns: the hidden beliefs, the quiet habits, the invisible lenses through which I see the world. They shape me, guide me, whisper to me… and yet I move through life unaware they even exist.

...

When we gather together, as we getting closer and open up. As we work together. This hidden beliefs and quiet habits clash. They can create tensions, misunderstanding, conflicts. We need to stay alert. We need to learn to bear with one another.

### Remins
We are people, we forget about these things. It can make our life together harder. Harder then it has to be. It's not like we don't know about our differances. No, often times we know about them. More than that, we also know what we should do too. It's just that we need a reminder.

### Romans 15:14-16
>¹⁴And concerning you, my brothers *and sisters,* I myself also am convinced that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able also to admonish one another.¹⁵But I have written very boldly to you on some points so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given to me from God,¹⁶to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, so that *my* offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.


### Romans 15:17-33
¹⁷Therefore in Christ Jesus I have found reason for boasting in things pertaining to God.¹⁸For I will not presume to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me, resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed,¹⁹in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit; so that from Jerusalem and all around as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.²⁰And in this way I aspired to preach the gospel, not where Christ was *already* known by name, so that I would not build on another person’s foundation;²¹but just as it is written: 

>“THEY WHO HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD ABOUT HIM WILL SEE, AND THEY WHO HAVE NOT HEARD WILL UNDERSTAND.”

>²²For this reason I have often been prevented from coming to you;²³but now, with no further place for me in these regions, and since I have had for many years a longing to come to you²⁴whenever I go to Spain—for I hope to see you in passing, and to be helped on my way there by you, when I have first enjoyed your company for a while—²⁵but now, I am going to Jerusalem, serving the saints.²⁶For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.²⁷For they were pleased *to do so,* and they are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they are indebted to do them a service also in material things.²⁸Therefore, when I have finished this, and have put my seal on this fruit of theirs, I will go on by way of you to Spain.²⁹I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.

>³⁰Now I urge you, brothers *and sisters,* by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,³¹that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea, and *that* my service for Jerusalem may prove acceptable to the saints;³²so that I may come to you in joy by the will of God and relax in your company.³³Now the God of peace *be* with you all. Amen.
