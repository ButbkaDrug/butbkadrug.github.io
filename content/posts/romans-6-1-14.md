### Romans 6:1-14
 ¹What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?²By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it?³Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?⁴We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.

 ⁵For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.⁶We know that our old self  was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.⁷For one who has died has been set free  from sin.⁸Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.⁹We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.¹⁰For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God.¹¹So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.

 ¹²Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions.¹³ Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness.¹⁴For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.

## START

Last Sunday we talked about the issue of the original sin. The scriptures tells us that we all affected by it. Corruption that flows from the Adam our forefather, down to every single human being. Contamination at the source. It effects all of us, regardless of the nation or any other factor. And there is no such thing as an environment that is so perfect, that one can live a holy life. It is simply impossible because contamination is not external but internal. The impurity of the people is not caused by the external factors. External circumstances definitely can work as a multiplier. But if we would look at the root, we are broken inside. And we cannot fix the issue ourselves.

That only though Jesus we are justified. Before that we talked that justification is not something that we can earn. But it is something that comes as a free gift, by the grace of God. It is garanteed to everyone who believe in Jesus Christ. This promise backed by God and is available to everyone.

But when I say that justification is apart from work, that it is gift of God. And it is not something we can earn. It can rise the question. If maybe we can continue to live in sin, since Jesus paid for all our sins?
