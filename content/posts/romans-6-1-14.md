## START
We continue our study of the book of Romans. Today we are up to chapter 6. We will cover the first half of the chapter today. And let's start form gathering a little bit of context. It is always helpful but espesially useful for those who are new and did go over all previous chapters with us, or if you like me and tend to forget things over time.

Last Sunday we talked about the issue of the original sin. The scriptures tells us that we all affected by this phenomena. Corruption that flows from Adam, our forefather, down to every single human being. Contamination at the source as it has been stated. It effects all of us, regardless of the nation or any other factor. We discovered that in a contrary to a common conseption that all people are born pure, and the corruption is the fault of their surrounding. Biblical perspective is that there can be no environment that is so perfect , that one can live a holy life. Simply because our contamination is not external but internal. Broken state of the people is not just a result of an external factors. External circumstances definitely can work as a multiplier. But if we would look at the root of the issue, we are fundamentally broken inside. Our nature is contaminated by the sin.

And that is the problem because God is not compatible with sin. He is perfectly holy and nothing sinful can withstand his presents. You can think about God's holyness as a fire. Imagine yourselves in the forest at the night time. It's dark, it's cold. It's scary. All that was very familiar just a moment ago can no longer be recognized. But, you can see a fire in between trees. You see the light. It gives you hope. It's not so scare anymore. You start to walk towards the light. As you get closer, you start to feel the warmth. It comfarts you. You heart the crackle of the wood as it burns. You can sit next the fire and the night is not so scary anymore.

But what would happen if you will get to close? If you will stick your heads or feet right into the fire? They will burn. Pain. Distruction. We all know the feeling.

That is why prophet Isaiah was so scared when he found himself in the presents of God.

>### Isaiah 6:5(NLT)
>Then I said, “It’s all over! I am doomed, for I am a sinful man. I have filthy lips, and I live among a people with filthy lips. Yet I have seen the King, the LORD of Heaven’s Armies.”

Anything that unclean will perish in the presents of God. That is why we need to be purified in order to be with God.

And as the water that has to go through the filtration in order to return to it's original, pure state. We are getting purified by faith in Jesus Christ. We explored that justification is not something that we can earn by doing(or not doing) things. It is something that comes as a free gift, by the grace of God, though faith. Justification guaranteed to everyone who believe. This is a promise that backed by God and it is available to everyone. It only requires faith and the rest is covered by the grace of God. Uniqness of God's grace is that it's always enough. There is no sin that is so great that God's grace would not be able to cover.

And again it was quite a revolutionary statement back in the day. And I also think that even today many people do not fully understand that. A lot of people live in the world were justification, or forgiveness comes by following tradition, following rules. By doing the right thing. Back in the day it was circumcision and following "The Law". And when we say that justification comes apart from work, that it is the gift of God that comes by grace.Our human logic derives conclusion. The view that gained popularity recently. But which in fact nothing new. Back in the day of Paul, people already was tricked by this.

### Hyper Grace theology
This new teaching that flooded the minds of people all over the world. Is called "Hyper Grace teaching". Which is effectively focuses ONLY on God's grace and disregard everything else. Some key point would be

* Once saved, a believer is permanently righteous in God's eyes, regardless of behavior.
* There is no need to ask for forgiveness repeatedly, because all sins are already forgiven.
* Jesus’ earthly teachings (pre-cross) were still under the Old Covenant. Therefore, much of what Jesus said (e.g., Sermon on the Mount) was aimed at Jews under the Law, not directly at Christians today.

Those are just a few highlights and not a comprehensive list of key differences. By the rough estimate tens of millions of christians today following this false teachings. There is a good chance that there is more than one person right in this room who follow this teachings. Theaching that criticized by pretty much every major christian confession along with the bible itself.

If we would condense the doctrine of the hyper grace into a one question, we would effectively get the verse 1 of the chapter 6:

### Romans 6:1
 ¹What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?

In other words if justification requires no works. And grace is always enough, maybe then I can continue to live the way I lived before I came to Christ Jesus? All my sins are covered by the work of the cross, so who cares if I continue to sin...

> ### Romans 6:2-4
> ²By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it?³Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?⁴We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.

#### Short answer is "No, you cannot continue in sin."

Aboundance of God's grace is not a license to sin.

### Romans 6:3
³Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?

All the readers of the Pauls letter were baptized. It was, and still is a very important Christian practise and the command of Jesus. Everyone 

 ⁵For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.⁶We know that our old self  was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.⁷For one who has died has been set free  from sin.⁸Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.⁹We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.¹⁰For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God.¹¹So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.

 ¹²Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions.¹³ Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness.¹⁴For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.
