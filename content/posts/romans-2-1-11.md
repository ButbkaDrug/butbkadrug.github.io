## God is the righteous judge.
We continue our journey through the book of Romans. And today we up to chapter two. The issues that will be discussed to day, are very old and still very relevant. You see, apparently not everything improves over time. And today we face the same issues people have had over 2000 years ago. So, let's be sensitive to a Holy Spirit tonight and let's let God change our way of thinking as we dive into his word.

### Romans 2:1
>¹Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things.


It is interesting point Paul making here. He just finished describing the state of society. And how did people end up in such poor state. And interestingly enough we can observe that our societies not too much different 2000 years later. And it is important observation. Why? Because, our society still rejects God. Our educational system claims that people came out of monkeys. There were very primitive and stupid and developed over time. And only the smartest would survive and that is why WE ARE the smartest people ever existed. And those lost tribes who still leave in the jungles hardly having any culture or language are the proof, because they never came out of their tribal state of life, and by looking at them we can see how world worked X thousands or millions years ago. And therefore there is no God. And therefore WE ARE "Gods" and shell worship ourselves only.

But we can see that Bible argues otherwise. That if people refuse to submit to God and acknowledge and worship him, they step away form wisdom and degraded. And those tribes are the example of what happens to people who do not worship God. And we can see all the signs of rebel again God in the world around us today. Lat's look again at verses 29 to 32 of the chapter 1

### Romans 1:29-32
>29 They are filled with every kind of sin, evil, greed, and hatred. They are full of jealousy, murder, fighting, lying, and thinking the worst things about each other. They gossip 30 and say evil things about each other. They hate God. They are rude, proud, and brag about themselves. They invent ways of doing evil. They don’t obey their parents, 31 they are foolish, they don’t keep their promises, and they show no kindness or mercy to others. 32 They know God’s law says that anyone who lives like that should die. But they not only continue to do these things themselves, but they also encourage others who do them.

Perfect description of the state of the world isn't it? All this things we CAN SEE. They are easy to identify and point too. This is how society of the day of Paul worked. And a lot of same attitudes is in the world today. This is what you see looking out of our church window. Right? Last Sunday we talked about corruption. Corruption of minds of individuals and corruption of the society as a whole. 

### Example
But you now what. There is a hope for this world! Corruption did not affected all people. Not everyone are as bed as verses 29-32 of chapter 1 describe. One can say Praise God I are nothing like that. I go to church at least twice a month, I'm a regular *fella*. I pray every day(almost). And you know what? I give tithe! God should be happy with me. Praise God I'm not like those sinners. 

Sounds somewhat familiar? There were a parable that Jesus told people:

### Luke 18:10-14
¹⁰“Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.¹¹The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed  thus: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.¹² I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.’¹³But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’¹⁴I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”

Reading this we can see 2 different ways to approach **life**, shell we say. This parable is somewhat relevant to our topic today so, please keep it in mind.

### The Problem
Back in the day Society were in the bad state before God. And we identified that our society today is not much better. But on the other hand the Church of the day had a problem too. The stumbling block which to this day tripping people over. **Moralism** that goes hand in hand with **Hypocrisy**:

### Who is Moralist?
A moralist is a person who:

    Believes in and promotes a strict set of moral principles, often focusing on what is right and wrong behavior.

    Judges others based on moral standards, especially concerning issues of conduct, ethics, or propriety.

    May sometimes be seen as overly concerned with morality, especially in a judgmental or preachy way.

Let's also see who is Hypocrite:
    * A hypocrite is someone who preaches one thing but does another—they don’t live by the same rules they impose on others.

Moralism && Hypocrisy. Dangerous mixture. And unfortunately churches are historically known to be subjected to this issue. In the bad way. Jesus criticized Pharisees for that. But it is not specific to any particular nation. Let's see in the verse 1:

### Romans 2:1
>¹Therefore you have no excuse, O man, **every one of you** who judges.

You see, it were not exclusive to Jewish believers only, as some might think. No, this is the disease that can affect anyone if you are not careful.

## High moral standards are good
Let's clarify that high moral standards are **NOT Evil**. God sets this standards. And those who live in God's kingdom should strive to adhere to His expectations. To be more like our Father. Those **standards**, as we call them, are simply are guard rails that do not let us hurt ourselves and others. So, it not like we try to be good boys and girls to keep our God happy, while burning with all kids of desires on the inside. Rotting inside out. No, we live up to those standards because they bring good to us as well as to people around us.

### Examples
    * I don't cheat on my wife NOT because "God does not allow it", but because I love her.

    * I do not take over things that belong to my brother, not because "God will not be happy with me", but because I don't want to cause damage to him, I love my brother.

Let's keep reading to see WHAT is the problem:

### Romans 2:1-3
For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things.²We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who practice such things.³Do you suppose, O man — you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself — that you will escape the judgment of God?

Moralist condemn others for their visible sins. He can point his finger at those people and say "How could they do that?". It is so wrong, I would never do anything like that. But, reality is that the state of his, moralist's heart **IS THE SAME** as heart of the person he condemns. He commits the same kid of sin he judges others for. Maybe in a slightly less obvious way. **In secret**. The moralist's math is broken. In their math 1/2 != 0.5. In their judgments the sentence is greatly depends on WHO is under the trial. Is it me, or someone else?

And every one of us prone to such attitude. And you can go that route. It is an easy one. It is so easy to judge others and justify yourself. Or even better, you stay blind to your own flaws. But then, one day. If God is good to you, one day you will find yourself doing exact same things you judge other for. And then, if you are able to humble yourself, you will say "God, be merciful to me, a sinner!".

Paul says that the judgment of God RIGHTLY falls on **THOSE WHO PRACTICE** such things(those that we read in the chapter 1). All those who practice. Sometimes when we slip into that state of moralism and hypocrisy. We somehow think that God looks at our sin differently than on the sin of the world. We think it is OK for me because. I'm a strong christian. Because I understand, Because I'm not under the law. Because, I'm lead by spirit. Pick your favorite excuse, or you can suggest your own.

We deceive ourselves if we think this way because judgment of God **FALLS** on those who practice. End of equation. There are no IF's no additional or hidden conditions. Sin is sin, and that's that.

Why do we do that? Why do we tent to think this way?

### Romans 2:4,5
⁴Or do you **presume** on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?⁵But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.

καταφρονέω (kataphronéō) - κατά = down, against && φρονέω = to think, to have an opinion or mindset
**Meaning:** To look down on, despise, treat with contempt, or consider something or someone as worthless.

dispise/presume i.e., to think little of, to scorn, or to treat with disrespect.

God's kindness get's treated with disrespect. Get's miss interpret.

### Example with kids
If you have kids, they illustrate this principle extremely well. They know the rules of the house. For example they know they not allowed to play screens on school days. They have their turn to do the dishes. They should not though their cloth and toys all over the place. They know all that. Simple, reasonable rules that make life together possible.

But they do break them. And as a parents we not always immediately in their face about it. We give them grace and time. You know, deep in your heart you hope that they will actually do those things, fix their cloth and do the dishes and what not. Maybe later they will get to it. But often they do not. You can see them playing screens when they not suppose too. You do not tell them right a way, to give them chance to stop it on their own. But instead more often then not they only start doing more of it.

Somehow they do not appreciate you patience, they do not fix their behavior. Instead they interpret it as a permission to break the rules. Until the **day of wrath** as scriptures would call it. When judgment of the parents will RIGHTLY FALL on THOSE WHO PRACTICED such things.

- "Don't you not know you not allowed to do screens?"
- "We know it"
- "Don't you know you have to do XYZ?"
- "We know"
- "Then why don't you do what you should?"
**And silence is the answer**

And your kindness and forbearance were interpret as a cancellation signal. As if all the rules suddenly changed. I bring out the example from the life of a parent. But it is not only true for kids.

We as God's children is very good at this as well. In the same way God give us chance to fix our ways. To stop doing evil. And he delays the day of wrath. Giving us chance to repent. To turn away from the wrong things we do. But somehow because we haven't been stroked by the lightning very second we did wrong, we interpret His kindness and forbearance and patience as a permission to go ahead and continue. 

We all know the rules. We look at the world around us and condemn those people, we judge the wicked system. But what about our own hearts?

Somehow we think that there is no more such thing as a **sin** for us. Because we going to church. Because we call ourselves "Christians". 

We've seen this example when a unmerried couple live together, and they think they are OK with God, because they go to church. As if sin is not a sin anymore if you come to a certain building once a week for an hour and a half. No it is not. 

### Romans 2:6-11
>⁶ He will render to each one according to his works:⁷to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life;⁸but for those who are self-seeking  and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury.⁹There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek,¹⁰but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek.¹¹For God shows no partiality.

Roman justice system was very partial. Your social status and wealth could dramatically impact verdict. Same can be true for our day and time. If you have right connections you can get away with things. And people come to the God with the same mentality. Jews thought they will be forgiven because they are God's special people. Gentiles I'm sure had their reasons as well.

Recently the person who spent most of his life serving at the church. Who were Pastors assistant, and many other things. Worked for church for years. Got into the state of believing that God will forgive everyone. It doesn't matter what you do quoting the bible saying "In Adam all died, in Christ all will live"... It is so sad. May be you think the same way. Let's read the verse 6 again:

### Romans 2:6
>⁶ He will render to each one according to his works:

and verse 11

### Romans 2:11
¹¹For God shows no partiality.

Our God is just. His judgment is true. Let's remember that non of us could yearn salvation by doing good. It is impossible to the man. We are forgiven because of Jesus Christ if we ask God for forgiveness in His name we will be forgiven

But if you think you can reamain in your sins. Thinking that it is somehow OK. That at least you are "not like those sinners". Then you are in the bed state. You need to repent and come to the truth. 


We are not called to be Moralists. We are definitely not called to be Hippocrates. Moral standards do not save people. Following rules do not save people. Doing good works do not save people. Faith in Jesus Christ saves people. Repentance and being born again that's what changes people. Love that what changes people.

And if you think you can live in sin and be ok with God. Then you are *** and there is no truth in you.
