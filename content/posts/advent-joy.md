### START
Greetings Church. We are 10 Days away from Christmas. It is coming fast. Today we going to continue reflect on the birth of Christ. It is time to light up our second candle and talk about Joy.


...

I want to start with a question. What is joy?

...

When you hear word **joy** what comes to your mind?

...

For me it would be words like *happiness*, *laughter*, *smile*... And it's all very good words. When we hear **joy**, or to be **joyful**, many of us immediately think about **happiness**, or **to be happy**. The state when everything goes well. When everything is right. For myself, as well as for many other people *joy* and *happiness* are interchangeable terms. Two ways to say the same thing.



Now..., you probably already know this, but I was surprised to learn that *happiness* and *joy* is **NOT** in fact the same thing. At least from the biblical point of view.

>**Happiness is our reaction to circumstances and external events.**

A reaction to things going well.

### Happiness
You buy something at a much lower price - you feel happy. You receive a gift - you feel happy. You caught a fish, or fixed something. Or you paid your bills and despite all odds you still have money left in your wallet, nothing makes you more happy that this. Whatever it might be - good circumstances that triggers your positive reaction. That's what we understand by **being happy**. But because it's only a **reaction** - it is fully dependent on the situation, circumstances.

### Difference
Happiness can be momentary. You can feel happy for a brief moment, few minutes, couple hours. But, overall still live in depression, misery, apathy. It is only when something very good happens you can experience this *spike* in happiness. Which quickly dies down.

In other words **happiness - it's when the source of your joy is external**. 

It's like relying on the rain as a source of your drinking water. You have no control over it. Your life is fully at the mercy of the weather. And sometimes our life can be like rain forests of Ajara. When it rains hard practically every day.

### NIKO AT HALA
Once we did the first day of our NIKO camp at Mtirala rain forest in the rainy season. NIKO is kind of extreme camp. You can even say it's somewhat like a boot camp. A lot of challenge both physical and mental, a lot of hiking and all that. Basically, rain is not something we worry about at all at the NIKO camps. Actually we pray for the rain at least some days of the camp to introduce more drama into challenges your going through. 

But that time in Mtirala, was different. It was raining. If fact we got so much rain. You can't even imagine. It was literally the wall of rain. You get wet immediately, unless you hide somewhere. Rain makes so much noise, you have to shout right into the ear of the person next to you, if you want to be heard.

We could not do anything. We where hours behind the schedule. Because, it rained so hard. There were little rivers appearing out of nowhere and flowing around us. It was impossible to continue our program. Because of how much rain there is.

And if we at such stage of your life. When everything goes well. You have more then enough reasons to be happy. You can think that there is no problem. Who cares about the well, when you get so much rain!

We might thing we are in no need of fullness of joy. That momentary happiness is good enough. We can live happily without God. 

Because of the abundance of the rain, relying on it doesn't seems to be an issue. You might think what's a big deal? I have plenty of water.


### OUR LIFE NOT A RAIN FOREST
Unfortunately for the most of us life is not a rain forest. I know some of us today lacking in the happiness department. Feeling apathy, indifference. Maybe depression. More often life feels like a desert, then a rain forest.

Or maybe we just don't have anything to collect the water with. So, even when it rains you just stand there with your mouth open. Trying to catch as many drops of water as possible. Hoping it will satisfy your thirst. It is not very effective strategy. Believe me, I've tried. It's not going to work.

For the vast majority of the people relying on the rain is simply not an option. Just like we can't live without water, we cannot live without joy. And as rain cannot fulfill our need in fresh drinking water. In the same way momentary happiness not going to be enough.

### Joy
On the other hand we have **joy**. Which although not the opposite of happiness, still different. It has deeper meaning. **fullness of joy** as it described in the bible is **an enduring state that persists regardless of whether circumstances are** good or bad.

Unlike momentary nature of happiness that this world has to offer. The Joy that comes from God is constant. Feeling of happiness deepens on ever changing circumstances. But joy is permanent and does not depend on situation. Joy is superior in every way. And it is a **free gift** that comes from God.

### Luke 2:10
¹⁰And *so* the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the people;

Joy of God is inclusive. It is for **ALL PEOPLE**. It is available for you and me. No Credit Card required! All you need is written in John 7:38

### John 7:38
³⁸The one who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.’ ”

It is about change in you. That starts with repentance. You cannot experience the fullness of joy that comes from God until you reconcile with Him. Fullness of Joy comes thought the work of the Holy Spirit in us.

Momentary happiness not meant to last, just like rain it comes and goes. Like that brief spike of a nice feelings in the darkness of your life. Fullness of joy is different. It is enduring and persistent. Like a water spring. It's always flowing. It's not a flash of light that light up the darkness for a brief second. It's like turning light on casting out the darkness from you life.

### John 15:11
¹¹These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you, and *that* your joy may be made full.

When we receive **HIS** joy. We don't have to rely on external circumstances anymore. Our joy becomes complete. Made full. We don't have to rely on the rain. Because we have an unlimited source of the living water right within us. Always at hand so to speak. 


### DOESN'T MEAN NO SORROW
Fullness of Joy does not mean that from now on we will never ever be sad ever again. No, unfortunately we still live in the broken world. There is times for grief and sadness. Time to weep with those who weep and all that. It is only at the end of time all suffering will be passed away

### Revelation 21:4
⁴and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be *any* death; there will no longer be *any* mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away.”

In the future life we will have no reasons to be sad. But meanwhile even when you remain in the **fullness of joy**, you can still feel sad, maybe even feel unhappy at times. But it's only momentary. It's not overwhelming, not paralyzing or life controlling feeling. Even though sad at times overall you still live life full of joy.

Before his suffering on the cross Jesus told his disciples:

### John 16:22
²²Therefore you too have grief now; but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one *is going to* take your joy away from you.

Fullness of Joy that Jesus offers to us. Is not mere reaction to trouble free, easy life. He does not say you will not be challenged. No. Instead Jesus offers us a source of strength to overcome challenges. New way of living when we stay joyful even when not everything goes well. 

Jesus offers us His Joy which does not depend on external circumstances. Joy that stays, lasts. 

The coming of Jesus marked a pivoting point in the history of mankind. Jesus came to show us the Father. He came to set us free. To change our occupation. When Jesus was here on earth he preached that kingdom of God is at Hand. 

### Mark 1:15
¹⁵and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.”

If we want to have part in the fullness of joy. You need to change your occupation. And become a citizen of the Kingdom of God. His peace and joy comes after we surrender to Him. Not before.

### Romans 14:17
¹⁷for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.

Only in the Kingdom of God we can find fullness of joy. Through the Holy Spirit.

### Galatians 5:22
²²But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,

Holy Spirit lives in those who surrender to God. Who follow him. Holy Spirit lives in every child of God. You cannot see Holy Spirit. But once you starting to get filled with the Holy Spirit, it becomes noticeable. There is a visible fruit of His presents in your heart.

### EXAMPLE??
Couple years ago we went to hike with Teenagers. New route in the mountains of Adjara. It was a special one because you have to apply for permission ahead of time. But we got approved by the border police and happily took of.

Those days I was on a strict diet. 0 carbs, period. In addition to that I ate only once a day. Later in the afternoon. It will be important later on.

You know, I was relatively fit my entire life. Hiking was never a problem for me. Usually I tent to walk last, but only to make sure no one left behind. Only hike that challenged me. Was the one with super steep trails, when I had to carry real heavy backpack plus a kid on my shoulders. This time we didn't take our kids with us. No heavy backpack ether. Therefore I did not anticipated any difficulty what so ever.

But I could not be more wrong. Less then a couple hundred meters into a hike I realized that something is not right. I was far behind everyone else, not because I was waiting on the slowest people in the group, but because I simply could not walk any faster. I was all the slowest people in our group.

My heart was phasing like crazy. I was short on breath. Every single step was a torture. Requiring 100% effort. I've thought I'm gonna have a heart attack or something. Never felt myself that bad in my entire life. Thinking to myself "Is that the hill I'm willing to die on??? I mean literally".

### CONNECTION
This is how life feels without a Holy Spirit. Without fullness of Joy that comes thought His work in us.

On the surface I was just fine. But a little bit of pressure and difference became evident.

### CONCLUSION
Do you lack joy in your life? Maybe today you suffer from chronicle depression, sadness, hopelessness. You lost your motivation, resilience, purpose... 


You don't have to continue to live like this. There is a better way. God offeres fullness of joy to all people. Who will be willing to believe.
