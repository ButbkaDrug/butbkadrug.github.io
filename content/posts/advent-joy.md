### START
Greetings, church. We are 10 days away from Christmas—it’s coming fast. Today we are going to continue reflecting on the birth of Christ. It’s time to light our second candle and talk about joy.


...

I want to start with a question: what is joy?

...

When you hear the word **joy**, what comes to your mind?

...

For me, it would be words like *happiness*, *laughter*, *smiles*… and those are all good words. When we hear **joy**, or to be **joyful**, many of us immediately think about **happiness**, or **being happy**. A state when everything goes well. When everything is right. For me, as well as for many other people, *joy* and *happiness* are interchangeable terms—two ways to say the same thing.



Now… you probably already know this, but I was surprised to learn that *happiness* and *joy* are **NOT** in fact the same thing — at least from a biblical point of view.

>**Happiness is our reaction to circumstances and external events.**

A reaction to things going well.

### Happiness
You buy something at a much lower price — you feel happy. You receive a gift — you feel happy. You catch a fish or fix something. Or you pay your bills and, despite all odds, still have money left in your wallet — nothing makes you happier than that. Whatever it might be, it’s good circumstances that trigger a positive reaction. That’s what we understand by **being happy**. But because it’s only a **reaction**, it is fully dependent on the situation and circumstances.

### Difference
Happiness can be momentary. You can feel happy for a brief moment — for a few minutes, a couple of hours — but overall still live in depression, misery, or apathy. It is only when something very good happens that you experience this *spike* in happiness, which quickly dies down.

In other words **happiness - it's when the source of your joy is external**. 

It’s like relying on rain as a source of drinking water. You have no control over it. Your life is fully at the mercy of the weather. And sometimes our life can be like the rainforests of Adjara — where it rains hard almost every day.

### NIKO AT HALA
Once we did the first day of our NIKO camp in the Mtirala rainforest during the rainy season. NIKO is a kind of extreme camp — you could even say it’s somewhat like a boot camp. There are a lot of challenges, both physical and mental, with plenty of hiking and all that. Basically, rain is not something we worry about at all at NIKO camps. In fact, we actually pray for rain on at least some days of the camp to add more drama to the challenges you’re going through.

But that time in Mtirala, it was different. It was raining — actually, we got so much rain, you couldn’t even imagine. It was literally a wall of rain all day long. You got wet immediately unless you hid somewhere. The rain made so much noise that you had to shout right into the ear of the person next to you if you wanted to be heard.

We couldn’t do anything. We were hours behind schedule because it rained so hard. Little rivers appeared out of nowhere and flowed around us. It was impossible to continue our program because of how much rain there was.

### CONNECTION
And if we are at such a stage of life when everything goes well, you have more than enough reasons to be happy. You might think there’s no problem — who cares about digging a well when you get so much rain!

We might think we are in no need of the fullness of joy — that momentary happiness is good enough. We can live happily without God. Or most likely, we simply don’t think about it at all. We feel happy — who cares where it’s coming from?

Due to the abundance of rain, relying on it doesn’t seem to be an issue. You might think, “What’s the big deal? I have plenty of water anyway.”


### OUR LIFE NOT A RAIN FOREST
Unfortunately, for most of us, life is not a rainforest — at least not for very long. I know some of us today are lacking in the happiness department, feeling apathy, indifference, maybe even depression. More often, life feels like a desert rather than a rainforest.

Or maybe we just don’t have anything to collect the water with. So even when it rains, you just stand there with your mouth open, trying to catch as many drops as possible, hoping it will satisfy your thirst. It’s not a very effective strategy — believe me, I’ve tried. It’s not going to work.

For the vast majority of people, relying on rain is simply not an option. Just like we can’t live without water, we cannot live without joy. And just as rain cannot fulfill our need for fresh drinking water, momentary happiness is not going to be enough.

### Joy
On the other hand, we have **joy**, which, although not the opposite of happiness, is still different. It has a deeper meaning. **Fullness of joy**, as it is described in the Bible, is **an enduring state that persists regardless of whether circumstances are** good or bad.

Unlike the momentary nature of happiness that this world has to offer, the joy that comes from God is constant. Feeling happy depends on ever-changing circumstances, but joy is permanent and does not depend on the situation. Joy is superior in every way, and it is a **free gift** that comes from God.

### Luke 2:10
¹⁰And *so* the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the people;

The joy of God is inclusive. It is for **ALL PEOPLE**. It is available for you and me — no credit card required! All you need is written in John 7:38.

### John 7:38
³⁸The one who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.’ ”

It’s about the change that happens in you. It starts with repentance. You cannot experience the fullness of joy that comes from God until you reconcile with Him. Fullness of joy comes through the work of the Holy Spirit in us.

Momentary happiness is not meant to last. Just like rain, it comes and goes—like that brief spike of a nice feeling in the darkness of your life.

Fullness of joy is different. It is enduring and persistent — like a water spring. It’s always flowing. It’s not a short-lived flash of light that brightens the darkness for a brief second. It’s like turning on a light, casting out the darkness from your life.

### John 15:11
¹¹These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you, and *that* your joy may be made full.

When we receive **HIS** joy, we don’t have to rely on external circumstances anymore. Our joy becomes complete — made full. We don’t have to rely on the rain because we have an unlimited source of living water right within us, always at hand, so to speak.


### DOESN'T MEAN NO SORROW
Fullness of joy does not mean that from now on we will never, ever be sad again. No — unfortunately, we still live in a broken world. There are times for grief and sadness, times to weep with those who weep, and all that. It is only at the end of time that all suffering will pass away.

### Revelation 21:4
⁴and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be *any* death; there will no longer be *any* mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away.”

In the future, we will have no reason to be sad. But meanwhile, even when you have the **fullness of joy**, you can still feel sad — maybe even unhappy at times. But it’s only momentary. It’s not overwhelming, paralyzing, or a life-controlling feeling. **Even though you are sad at times, overall you still live a life full of joy.**

Before his suffering on the cross Jesus told his disciples:

### John 16:22
²²Therefore you too have grief now; but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one *is going to* take your joy away from you.

The fullness of joy that Jesus offers us is not a mere reaction to a trouble-free, easy life. He does not say you will not be challenged. No.  Instead, Jesus offers us a source of strength to overcome challenges. A new way of living where we stay joyful even when not everything goes well.

Jesus offers us His Joy which does not depend on external circumstances. Joy that stays, lasts. 

<!--FIX: The coming of Jesus marked a pivoting point in the history of mankind. Jesus came to show us the Father. He came to set us free. To change our occupation. When Jesus was here on earth he preached that kingdom of God is at Hand. 

### Mark 1:15
¹⁵and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.”

If we want to have part in the fullness of joy. You need to change your occupation. And become a citizen of the Kingdom of God. His peace and joy comes after we surrender to Him. Not before.

### Romans 14:17
¹⁷for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.

Only in the Kingdom of God we can find fullness of joy. Through the Holy Spirit.
-->

Fullness of joy comes from the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives. When we surrender to God and get filled with His Spirit, it becomes evident. We often call it the "fruit" of the Spirit — the results or noticeable changes in our life that come when we repent. When we turn away from OUR way of life. Go back to our Father to accept **His** will.

### Galatians 5:22
²²But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,

The Holy Spirit lives in those who surrender to God and follow Him. The Holy Spirit lives in every child of God. You cannot see the Holy Spirit, but once you start to get filled with Him, it becomes noticeable. There is a visible fruit of His presence in your heart. We talked about peace last week — perfect peace that comes from God. It is a fruit of the Spirit. And when we think about joy, it also comes as a result of the Holy Spirit living in us.

### EXAMPLE
A couple of years ago, we went on a hike with teenagers—a new route in the mountains of Adjara. It was a special one because you had to apply for permission ahead of time. But we got approval from the border police and happily set off.

Those days, I was on a strict diet: 0 carbs, 0 sugar, period. In addition, I ate only once a day, later in the afternoon, or sometimes, secretly, every other day. It was an optional part of the diet, but I decided to do that too. It will be important later on.

You know, I had been relatively fit my entire life. Hiking was never a problem for me. Usually, I tended to walk last, but only to make sure no one was left behind. The only hike that challenged me was the one with super-steep trails, when I had to carry a really heavy backpack plus a kid on my shoulders. This time, we didn’t take our kids with us—no heavy backpack either. Therefore, I did not anticipate any difficulty whatsoever, or at least nothing that would be seriously challenging.

...

I could not have been more wrong. Less than a couple hundred meters into the hike, I realized that something was not right. I was far behind everyone else—not because I was waiting for the slowest people in the group. No, it was because I simply could not walk any faster. **I** was **the** slowest person in our group.

My heart was racing like crazy. I was short of breath. Every single step was torture, requiring 100% effort. I thought I was going to have a heart attack or something. I had never felt that bad in my entire life. I was thinking to myself, “Is this the hill I’m willing to die on? I mean, literally.”

### CONNECTION
This is how life feels without the Holy Spirit—without the fullness of joy that comes through His work in us.

On the surface, I was just fine. Not eating didn’t seem to be a problem for me. I didn’t feel hungry. But a little bit of pressure and difference became evident.

It's easy to be in a good place. To be a nice person, when everything goes well. When the circumstance of your life is where you want them to be. In this moment you can say I don't help of the Holy Spirit.

But when we are in a bad place — maybe we’ve made a bunch of mistakes, maybe our life in general is not *a walk in the park*. Or maybe everything looks fine on the surface, but inside there is no joy, no purpose, no meaning. We just roll through our days because that’s what we’ve always done.

### CONCLUSION
Maybe today you suffer from chronic depression, sadness, or hopelessness. You’ve lost your motivation, resilience, purpose…  

There is an answer. You don’t have to continue living like this. There is a better way. God offers the fullness of joy to all people who are willing to believe, who are willing to surrender to Him, and get filled with the Holy Spirit.

### Romans 15:13
 ¹³Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you will abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
