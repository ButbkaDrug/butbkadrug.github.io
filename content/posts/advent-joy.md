### START
Greetings Church. We are 10 Days away from Christmas. It is coming fast. Today we going to continue reflect on the birth of Christ. It is time to light up our second candle and talk about Joy.


...

I want to start with a question. What is joy?

...

When you hear word **joy** what comes to your mind?

...

For me it would be words like *happiness*, *laughter*, *smile*... And it's all very good words. When we hear **joy**, or to be **joyful**, many of us immediately think about **happiness**, or **to be happy**. The state when everything goes well. When everything is right. For me, as well as for many other people *joy* and *happiness* are interchangeable terms. Two ways to say the same thing.

Now, you probably already know this, but I was surprised to learn that *happiness* and *joy* is **NOT** the same thing. At least from the biblical point of view.

>**Happiness is our reaction to circumstances and external events.**

A reaction to things going well.

### Happiness
You buy something at a much lower price - you feel happy. You receive a gift - you feel happy. You caught a fish, or fixed something. Or you paid your bills and despite all odds you still have money left in your wallet, nothing makes you more happy that this. Whatever it might be - good circumstances that triggers your positive reaction. That's what we understand by **being happy**. But because it's only a **reaction** - it is fully dependent on the situation, circumstances.

### Difference
Happiness can be momentary. You can feel happy for a brief moment, few minutes, couple hours. But, overall live in depression, misery, apathy. It is only when something very good happens you can experience this *spike* in happiness. Which quickly dies down.

Simply put **happiness - it's when the source of your joy is external**. 

It's like relying on the rain as a source of your drinking water. You have no control over it. Your life is fully at the mercy of the weather. And sometimes our life can be like rain forests of Ajara. When it rains hard practically every day.

### NIKO AT HALA
Once we did the first day of our NIKO camp at Mtirala rain forest in the rainy season. NIKO is kind of extreme camp. You can even say it's somewhat like a boot camp. A lot of challenge, a lot of hiking and all that. Basically, rain is not something we typically worry about at all at the NIKO camps. Actually we pray to have rain at least some days of the camp to introduce more challenge. 

But that time in Mtirala. We got so much rain. You can't even imagine. It was literally the wall of rain. You get wet immediately, unless you hide somewhere. Rain makes so much noise, you have to shout right into the ear of the person next to you, if you want to be heard.

We could not do anything. We where hours behind the schedule. Because, it rained so hard. There were little rivers appearing out of nowhere and flowing around us. It was impossible to continue our program.

And at such stage of life you can think that there is no problem. Because of abundance of the rain, relying on it doesn't seems to be an issue. You might think what's a big deal? I have plenty of water.

### OUR LIFE NOT A RAIN FOREST
Unfortunately for the most of us life is not a rain forest. I know some of us today lacking in the happiness department. Feeling apathy, indifference. Maybe depression. Life can feel like a desert at times. Or maybe we just don't have anything to collect the water with. So, even when it rains you just stand there with your mouth open. Which is not very effective strategy. Believe me, I've tried. For the vast majority of the people relying on the rain is simply not an option. Just like we can't live without water, we cannot live without joy.

### Joy
On the other hand **fullness of joy** as it described in the bible is **an enduring state that persists regardless of whether circumstances are** good or bad. It's permanent state that does not depend on situation. It's a **gift** that comes from God.

### John 7:38
³⁸The one who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.’ ”


Unlike momentary happiness that not meant to last. Fullness of joy is an enduring, persistent state. It's is not like that brief spike of a nice feelings in the everlasting darkness of your life.

It's a change that starts in you. And eventually spreads outwards. It starts to spill out to those around you.

### John 15:11
¹¹These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you, and *that* your joy may be made full.

When we receive **HIS** joy. We don't have to rely on external circumstances anymore. We don't have to rely on the rain. We can have an unlimited source of the living water right within us. Always at hand so to speak. 

When you have **fullness of joy**, you can still feel sad, maybe even feel unhappy at times. But it's only momentary. It's not overwhelming, not paralyzing or life controlling. Overall you still live in joy.

Before his suffering on the cross Jesus told his disciples:

### John 16:22
²²Therefore you too have grief now; but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one *is going to* take your joy away from you.


Fullness of Joy that Jesus offers to us. Does not come from trouble free life. He does not promise that from now on we will have 0 issues. Instead He offers us source of strength to overcome those challenges. 


<!--NOTE: Thoughts-->
Happiness can be momentarly. You can feel momentarly happy. But, overall live in depression. Misarable and unhappy.

Joy is something at core level. You can be momentarly sad. But you overall you live in joy.

Joy comes with holy spirit. We are not nesseserly "feel" Holy Spirit. But we definetly can see the results of he's presents in us.

<!--NOTE: FULL JOY. True joy only in Jesus. -->
