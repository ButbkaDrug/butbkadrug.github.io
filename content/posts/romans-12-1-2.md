### Intro 
We continue our way thought the book of Romans. Today we are up to chapter 12.

Going through the book we explored many fundamental truth, which is important to know. Important to understand. In order to be able to comprehend what we actually believe in as followers of Christ. And avoid false believes and false teachings. Which are presented in abundance in our day and time.

### Keep it Simple
Some of the thing we talked about remain among "hot topics" among scalars for last few hundreds of years. People argue about those things in endless attempts to prove themselves right. But [show picture] *we don't do that here*. In Calvary Chapel our motto is:

>**Simply teach the Bible simply"**

We let the word of God speak. Keeping focus on Scripture, not human opinion or motivational content. We try to illuminate complex theological jargon, and intentionally speak in the simple language that everyone can understand. Maybe with occasional spiracle intellectual “fluff” for those of us who into such things. 

We believe that God’s Word + God’s Spirit will result in true transformation. And there is no need to be artificially flashy, dramatic, or persuasive by human effort.

I want everyone of us to seek what we need, whether it's motivation, comforting or inspiration. Not from a person, but from the Father who is in heaven. Even when those things come through a person we should keep in mind that the source of that living water is the Spirit of God.

So, let's say a word of prayer and let's let the Bible speak.

> ### Romans 12:1,2
>¹ I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.² Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.

#### Mercies
Today we going to talk about proper response to God's mercies. Chapters 1 through 11 explain what God did for us. His mercies include:

· Justification from the guilt and penalty of sin.

· Adoption in Jesus and identification with Christ.

· We Placed under grace, not law.

· Giving the Holy Spirit to live within.

· Promise of help in all affliction.

· Assurance of a standing in God’s election.

· Confidence of coming glory.

· Confidence of no separation from the love of God.

· Confidence in God’s continued faithfulness.

All this things granted to us in Jesus Christ. And there's a lot of good things. Way more then we ever desired. Especially considering the fact that WE are the rebels. We are the once's to blame for state of the world. Nevertheless God is full of mercy and offers us another chance. Considering all that what is the proper response?

John the baptists put's it this way:

>### Matthew 3:8
>Bear fruit in keeping with repentance.


### Life of worship
Short answer can be found in the verse 1 *"present your bodies as a living sacrifice..."*

Don't worry if you like me and can't immediately make sense of this phrase. There rest of the letter is a more or less explanation of this phrase. But before we will dive into specifics. There are few things to note in this verse.
<!--TIME: 04:00 -->

### Beseech
Verse 1 starts saying *"I appeal to you..."* or as other translations say *"I beseech you"*, *"I urge you"*, *"I beg you"*. Apostle Paul begs, pleads us to urgently do something. We will talk about **WHAT** he begs us to do in a minute. But, first let's pay attention to the pleading itself. Why Paul, has to beg, urge and beseech us?

#### Example [Picture]
Because you know, if you think about it. You typically don't have to beg for things that just happen "automatically". When I'm making a cup of tea for example. I put a tea bag and poor some hot water. And then tea magic just happens. I don't have to stay there and appeal to a tea bag to release it's goodness, that little bit of bitterness and color. And maybe a vitamin or two...

Imagine me talking to a tea bag:
>*"I urge you little one. For the sake of everything that good and holy, please let the infusion commence! I know you have a little more of that food coloring and road dust. After all I payed for you, I kept you in a dry place. I even pre-warmed the cup to make sure you are not cold! Please, don't be difficult!"*

Sounds funny right? It's just a silly and maybe too dramatic example, but I believe it can helps us to see something important.

Wne we come to God. When we repent. When we understand his mercies. Our life is not "automatically" becomes the "life of worship". It is not like making tea = "Take a sinner. Submerge him into God's mercies. Wait 3-5 minutes. Life of worship is ready..."

Our God not going to force us to love Him, to worship Him or to server Him. He loves us and respects our choices. He wants US to make a desicion to love, to worship to follow. Otherwise Paul would not have to appeal to us. You only have to appeal if it is up to someone else to decide.

God is not a tyrant or dictator who just taking things He wants. Making us, against our will if it is nessesery to do things, to live a certain way.

Here is a qote form one of my favorite fiction book, that portraise it very well:

#### Quote form Guards! Guards!
One of the characters reflects on his meeting with a Patrician, who is the head of the city and a sort of a tyrant:
>"You had to hand it to the Patrician, he admitted grudgingly. If you didn’t, he sent men to come and take it away."
>— Terry Pratchett, Guards! Guards!

Our Father is not like that. He not gonna force you to live for Him wether you like it or not. He waits for us with His arms wide open. He wishes from the depth of His heart that we would choose Him. But He not going to make this choice for us. The choice is yours.

And that is exactly why Paul have to appleal to us. Begging to make a right choice. Choice that benefits us the most.
<!--NOTE: Let's live it at that for now. And refactor later as nessesery -->

### Transition
Let's read the verse 1 again. I'll read from modern translation to make it a bit easier to understand

> ### Romans 12:1 NLT
>And so, dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God because of all he has done for you. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice—the kind he will find acceptable. This is truly the way to worship him

### Body - living secrifice
Paul tells us that the only resonable response to God's goodness is to *"give our body to God."* So that it becomes a living and holy sacrifice.

And when we say **"body"** you should think, not only about "flesh and bones", but rather about entire being. You know, our spirit, soul, flesh, and mind. It all come "packaged" in our body. When we present our body to God, soul and spirit comes with it.

We present our whole self — our actions, our choices, our daily life — fully to God as an act of worship, in response to His mercy.

**To present our body as a living secrifice is not dying for God, but living for Him every day**

This is the **"life of worship"**.

When we live for Him every single day, then our whole life becomes an act of worship. Not only in the church. Not only among other christians or people who know us. But also when we on our own. In our thoughts and desires. In our plans and vison for life.

### Examples
We can treat disrespectful people with respect as an act of worship for example. Sometimes you come across just unplesent, annoying and rude people. Our "natural" desire is to treat them the same way. Give them a dose of their own medecine so to speak. And it can be oddly satisfying for some reason. Don't ask me how I know it. But, we also have a different choice. We can remind ourselves that God loves them. And God would really really want us to treat them well, even though they don't desirve it. Act of true worship.

When you choose not to watch inoppropriate things. Even though no one gonna know. Not because you don't enjoy watching them. But because you know that it is not something that pleses God. That's true worship.

When in your thought, your dreams and fantasies you stay pure. Sometimes thoughts and images they come to your mind and not much you can do about it. But it's within your power not to let them stay there. To reject them.

And as we go into "mind" theritory let's read verse 2


>### Romans 12:2 ESV
>Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.


>### Romans 12:2 NLT
>Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God’s will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.

Honostly, I think it's one of the most difficult passeges to put into practice. If we would be honest, we should admit that often reality is qute opposite. We are despret to confirm to the worldview of this wolrd and then twist the bible to make it justify our behaviour...

And apperently last step is not required anymore, nowerdays you can simply say that certain parts of the bible are outdated and not relevant anymore. That seciety moved on and bible should too. And that will do it.

Loose sexual life is encoraged and promoted everywhere on media. Divorse portaied as a normal, everyday activity. There is hardly a movie nowardays without promotion of homosexual or lesbian relationships. Worldy system forces this views on us, especially on children. Why? Because ungodly system fights agains God. Satan want's to hurt Father's heart by causing His most beloved creations to die physicly as well as spiritually. And many christians try to stey "modern" and "up to date". They try to show to this wold "hey, we just like you. But we go to church on Sundays".

No, that's not the way. If today you one of those people who thinks that bible is outdated and some part's of it not relevant anymore, just as apostle Paul I beg you, by the mercy of God, to turn away from sin and turn to God. Let God to transform your mind by the new way of thinking.

We should let God to transofrm our way of thinking. And again, please note the word "let" in this sentance. God is not going to force the change.He waits on us. When we will surrender to Him

This world on the other hand will supress your will at first chance. The ungodly system Will lie, manipulate and will keep you down. Utilizing addictions and all kinds of other "assets" to make it as hard as possible for you to leave this lifestyle. Poluting our mind with all kinds of lies which most of the time lead to destruction of our body and soul. This wold is not your friend. 

But our Father who is in heaven is not like that. He doesn't force things on us. He let's us choose. He wants good for us. 

So, the main battle is in our mind. Main battle is for our will. Will we choice to present our body to God, or we will preset our body to this worldly system?

Are we going to let God transform us with a new way of thinking or we will let this world to continue to brainwash our heads?

Transofmation occures when we focus on God's word. When it tryly becomes a cornerstone of our life. When we fellowship with God. It will bring transformation. As we live the life of worship. Spirit of God will work in us, enabling us to continue.

### Example
When I had my first job(one of). I still lived at my parats home. Where I had a yanger sister. Two actully, but we going to focus on yanges. Most of the day I spent at the job site. I left home 07 in the mornign and would come back after midninght. I would pretty much only sleep there except for a day offs.

And during this time my little sister started to attend a kindergarden. I didn't talked to her for the first week, because I would leave while she is sleeping and come back home when she already sleeping. But on the Saturday, when I had no work. I was qute litterally shocked by how much she changed, and not in a good way. It was completely different child. She would cry, and demand and manipulate, disobey and so on and so forth.

She was submerged into a certain atmosphere. And she let that atmosphere influence her. And the canges came qute quckly.

It is on us. Which atmosphere we submerge ourselves into. Which influences we allow in our life. And unfortunately expiriance show us that it is qute easy to get addicted to this world and the things of this world. And it is much harder to reverse that damage.

But if we will submerge ourselves into God's word. Into His presents and let Him influence us. The changes will come. 

### Will of God
To live by the will of God or to live the life of worship we need:
1. Keep in mind his mercies(verse 1)
2. As an act of inteligent worship we should decide to present our entire self to Him( verse 1)
3. Resist conformity to the ungodly patterns of this World(Verse 2)
4. Let God transofrm our way of thinking via focus on God's word and fellowship with Him(Verse 2)
