### Intro 
We continue our way thought the book of Romans. Today we are up to chapter 12.

Going through the book we explored a lot fundamental truth, which is important to know. Important to understand. In order to be able to comprehend what you actually believe in. And avoid false believes and false teachings. Which are presented in abundance in our day and time.

### Keep it Simple
Some of the thing we talked about remain among "hot topics" among scalars for last few hundreds of years. People argue about those things in endless attempts to prove themselves right. But [show picture] *we don't do that here*. In Calvary Chapel our motto is:

>**Simply teach the Bible simply"**

We let the word of God speak. Keeping focus on Scripture, not human opinion or motivational content. We try to illuminate complex theological jargon, and intentionally speak in the simple language that everyone can understand. Maybe with occasional spiracle intellectual “fluff” for those of us who into such things. 

We believe that God’s Word + God’s Spirit will result in true transformation. And there is no need to be artificially flashy, dramatic, or persuasive by human effort.

I want everyone of us to seek what we need, whether it's motivation, comforting or inspiration. Not from a person, but from the Father who is in heaven. Even when this things come through a person we should keep in mind that the source of that living water is the Spirit of God.

So, let's say a word of prayer and let's let the Bible speak.

> ### Romans 12:1,2
>¹ I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.² Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.

#### Mercies
Today we going to talk about proper response to God's mercies. Chapters 1 through 11 explain what God did for us. His mercies include:

· Justification from the guilt and penalty of sin.

· Adoption in Jesus and identification with Christ.

· We Placed under grace, not law.

· Giving the Holy Spirit to live within.

· Promise of help in all affliction.

· Assurance of a standing in God’s election.

· Confidence of coming glory.

· Confidence of no separation from the love of God.

· Confidence in God’s continued faithfulness.

All this things granted to us in Jesus Christ. And there's a lot of good things. Way more then we ever desired. Especially considering the fact that WE are the rebels. We are the once's to blame for state of the world. Nevertheless God is full of mercy and offers us another chance. Considering all that what is the proper response?

### Life of worship
Short answer can be found in the verse 1 *present your bodies as a living sacrifice...* Don't worry if you like me and can't immediately say what that's mean. There rest of the letter is a more or less explanation of this short phrase. But before we will dive into specifics. There are few things to note in this verse.
