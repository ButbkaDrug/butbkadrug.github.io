As always we will start from a little recap from previous weeks. In case you haven't been here last time, we are going through the Book or Romans and we are up to a chapter 3. Last few Sundays we spent talking about the state of the world. The state of the church and the problem that exited at the time, which by the way even though changed it form a bit, but nevertheless still relevant. Problem that Holy Spirit addresses through apostle Paul, fulfilling the God's plan. Slowly but surely we advance towards new way of thinking and following the Lord. Waking away from justification by the works, to justification by faith.

Last Sunday we discussed that being right with God does not come because of the national factor. It Does not come by the shire factor of belonging to a specific group of people.

### Romans 2:28,29
²⁸For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical.²⁹But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God.

We were talking that being religious did not help Jews to be right with God. And not gonna help us as well. So, religiosity is not what we are after.

And Sunday before that we discussed that God shows no partiality and both Jews and Greeks(Gentiles) are in the pretty much same state before God. Which means that just having or knowing God's Law does not justify you. It does not put you in any sort of privileged position before God.

Simply put it will sound like "Mere being a Jew(Calling yourself Christian) and KNOWING God's law(God's word) doesn't automatically justifies you." Which was very contrary view for the people of the day. And it produced a question among the Jewish follower of Christ, question which we will address today.

### Romans 3:1-8
 ¹Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision?²Much in every way. To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.³ What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God?⁴By no means! Let God be true though every one were a liar, as it is written, 

“That you may be justified in your words, and prevail when you are judged.”

 ⁵But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.)⁶By no means! For then how could God judge the world?⁷But if through my lie God's truth abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?⁸And why not do evil that good may come? — as some people slanderously charge us with saying. Their condemnation is just.
