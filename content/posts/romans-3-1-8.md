As always we will start from a little recap from previous weeks. In case you haven't been here last time, we are going through the Book or Romans and we are up to a chapter 3. Last few Sundays we spent talking about the state of the world. The state of the church and the problem that exited at the time, which by the way even though changed it's form, still remains relevant. Problem that Holy Spirit addresses through apostle Paul, fulfilling the God's plan. Slowly but surely we advance towards new way of thinking, towards a new perspective on following the Lord. Drifting away from justification **by works**, and shifting our attention to justification **by faith**.

Last Sunday we discussed that being right with God does not come because of the national factor. It Does not come by the shire belonging to a specific group of people.

### Romans 2:28,29
²⁸For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical.²⁹But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God.

We talked that being **religious** does not help people. It did not help Jews to be right with God. And not gonna help us as well. So, religiosity is not what we are after. Loving God is not about following some rules, it's not about having high moral standards or practicing certain activities. It is all outward and visual but not necessarily reflect inner state of man. If you think that going to church makes you right with God, it is not. It you think that **live for God** it to follow the set of rules, it is not. God pleased with people who are circumcised at their heart, in the Spirit. As it emphasized in the 2nd chapter.

And so being a Jew, having a physical circumcision, practicing the law. Not gonna justify you before God.

It was very contrary view for the people of the day. And it produced a question among the Jewish(and not only Jewish) follower of Christ, question which we will address today:

### Romans 3:1
>¹Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision?

If belonging to God's nation does not "buy" you pass to God's kingdom. If it's not a basis for justification. What's a point then? Why would you bother to live a life devoted to God. It does not make any sense. For hundreds of years people believed that this is how you get justified before God. By being one of His special people. By following the law. And if that is not true. If God will judge all people the same way, what advantage have His **"special"** people?

### Romans 3:2-4
>²Much in every way. To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.³ What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God?⁴By no means! Let God be true though every one were a liar, as it is written, 

“That you may be justified in your words, and prevail when you are judged.”

The people of Israel do have an advantage. But, it is not what they thought. The advantage is not that God will treat their sin any different. It is not that God will evaluate their life according to some different standards. No, we already figured that God shows no partiality. He does not respect the outward circumstances of the man.

ESV translation says "to begin with". Which in my opinion is not the best way to translate that phrase. Because, Paul does not present list things. At least right here. But rather emphasized importance of one of them. I think the better way to put it would be like in KJV "Chiefly" or like in NIV "First of all".

The most important advantage is that God trusted Jewish people with his word. It is to them God decided to revile Himself. Though them we have written word of God today. To them God reveled His will, His plans, and His ways. They have received God's promises, His blessings. To them God sent His son. God decided to bless entire humanity via them. If that's not an advantage I don't know what is.

### Romans 3:3
³ What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God?

Unfortunately big portion of God's special people didn't rejected God's blessing. They did not believe in Jesus, the Son of God. The messiah, the savior of the world. And it might seems like now God's plans failed, nullified. His very special people have blown it. And now the rest of the world not gonna get those sweet blessings of God because those guys messed it up!

Praise God, it is not the case. Let's look into next verse. I will use a modern translation for sake of ease of understanding:

### Romans 3:4 (NLT)
Of course not! Even if everyone else is a liar, God is true. As the Scriptures say about him,

“You will be proved right in what you say,
and you will win your case in court.”

Luckily for us, there is nothing that can stop God's plan from coming into truth. God's plan will come into existence regardless. Because God is always true to His word. And the basis of His promises is Himself, and that is why we can rely on God more the anything else. God and His world are truly immutable. They never change. Even if every last man will turn away from God, he will still be true in His promises. He's judgment is always right.


### Romans 3:5-8
>⁵But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.)⁶By no means! For then how could God judge the world?⁷But if through my lie God's truth abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?⁸And why not do evil that good may come? — as some people slanderously charge us with saying. Their condemnation is just.

 I don't know about you but, I had to reread this text over and over again. Because I just could not get grasp of what is Paul saying. I mean in general sense I see where he is going. But exact phrases that he uses appeared to be a little daunting.
