## Intro
Last time we spent a lot of time looking at the context of the book and less time reading the scriptures. Today we will try to do the opposite. There are still few important historical mentions that we need to consider in order to better understand the application and the meaning of the scriptures. In case you were not here last Sunaday let me quickly summarize what we talked about.

#### Summery of last Sunday
Last time we looked at the historical background of the letter to the church(es) in the city of Rome. We talked about **Saul of Tarsus** and how he relates to the story. We also looked at formation of the church in Rome. And little bit of what the church been going through, what kind of challenges they have experienced at the time of the letter. Today we might expand on that a little bit more, but before we will do that let's start with our scriptures.

### Romans 1:1-17
>¹Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,²which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,³concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh⁴and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,⁵through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations,⁶including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,

>⁷To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: 

>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.


#### Recap of the verse 1
As a recap from the last week, in the beginning of his letter Paul introduces himself and also provides the prove of his authority and expertise. We figured that Paul indeed have all the authority to speak into the life of the church in Rome, even though he did not start it. And this letter speaks to us as much as to it's original receivers. Paul is a messenger of God, who were divinely appointed, sent forth with orders from the master.

#### Why he talks about Gospel?
Starting from the verse 2 Paul starts to preset the Gospel or the Good News, that he is a servant off. Why would he do that? He writes to the church that exists for a number of years. Church that is active and famous in the Christian circles? There might be several reasons. But I want to focus on the one I believe to be the major. And to explain it well I need to start from a far. So, please bear with me for a moment.

### The problem
Christian movement of the first century were rapidly growing among the Jews as well as among non-Jewish cultures. And that presented a problem, which in our days we don't even consider. The problem were **"what to do with the non Jewish believers?"**. You might have a question, "What do you mean by that?" But If you thing about it for the moment, you will see the root of the issue.

### Jewish roots
Jesus and his disciples were Jews. There were born in that culture. They followed their traditions like Circumcision, rules about the food, law of Moses, observing the Sabbath and other Religious celebrations. That all was a part of their life. And Jesus never spoke against those things. He never taught people or his disciples that they should stop following those traditions, culture and religion. As some believed and falsely accused Jesus of it. In fact this is what the Jesus said:

### Matthew 5:17
>¹⁷ “Do not think that I have come to abolish(destroy) the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.

So, in the minds of Jewish people if anyone would want to come and follow **their God**. And at that point they have had a exclusive rights to follow God. They were His special people. His nation.  It was possible, but whoever want's to worship God, have to become a Jew. Which means: Get circumcised, start observing the law and etc. It was pretty standard approach that worked for hundreds of years. And that is exactly how apostles thought as well. Peter "the rock" who was the head of the church, had this view for a quite some time. John and others too. Any regular Jew, and especially those who knew the law well would think that. Not because they are bed people. But because that was the only available option from the perspective of the Holy Scriptures for a hundreds if not thousands of years. People did not even thought that there could be other options. And therefore it was a standard position of a Jewish follower of Christ. **If you want to follow Christ. If you want to be a part of this hope, this wonderful promise. You need to follower everything else as well. You have to be a Jew in all regards.** 

### Some Numbers
Let me give you some number to help you understand the scale. Jesus died at the year AD 30 - 33. Approximately. That's when the church were born. This is timing of Acts 2, when Peter preaches and 3000 people get baptized at one day. And every day after that more people start joining the church. They all were **Jews**. They gathered at the temple every day. Which clearly points out that they have not changed their traditions a bit. Then, after persecution on the Church in Jerusalem people flee. They went home to their cites all over the place  and founded local communities there. This is when, most likely church in Rome were started as well. But remember it's still were all Jews. With their Jewish mindset and worldview. And only at the year **AD 48–50**. Which is **17 years** later. We have Acts chapter 15 when Church **officially** makes up it's mind about non Jewish believers. Just think about, first 17 years. It's a loong time. But then, even after the council in Jerusalem, after church "officially allowed" non Jewish believers not to be converted to Judaism to follow Christ, it took a loooong time to spread this news around. And even longer to make people accept this, and change their mind.

### New Theology
So, when the apostle Paul came up with a new way of thinking. Which we will see in the moment. But simply pot it is that salvation comes by the faith alone. It have created controversy among the Jewish believers. Many people rejected this idea. It went against everything they ever knew and believed. There were apposed.

There were talks and rumors about Paul's teaching. Because, you know, because people didn't even heard Paul's teaching. They would rely on sources of information like "Bro told me that the guy he knew heard Paul saying X". Misinterpretation, misrepresentation and attempts to compromise Paul and his words have taken place. Not nesseserly because Jewish believers were all that bad. No, simply because those ideas, "being God's special nation and having exclusive access to God" were solidified in their minds over the Generations. To set be set apart for God was equal to be a Jew. Which was equal to follow the tradition. And in his letter Paul takes the opportunity to clarify to the Jewish believers and Gentiles his position. What is this Gospel he is teaching. Not because they did not know Gospel, but to assure them that **His** Gospel is the same Gospel they believed. And he starts to build the foundation to prove his position to be true and illuminate that controversy.

### Romans 1:3-6
³concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh⁴and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,⁵through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations,⁶including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,

In this scriptures we see very condensed story of Jesus the messiah. Only the most important key points, to prove that he is not preaching some other Gospel. He, Paul, is preaching  Jesus who were Jew according to flesh. He is descended from David exactly like God is promised in the Holy Scriptures. But also he is Son of God, which were proved by his resurrection. This is Gospel, Good News that we all believed. Jews and Gentiles. Paul reminds that **though Jesus** we received grace. We received salvation. And also, same Jesus, appointed him to be his apostle, to do his work. Paul reminds us that he has the authority, that comes from the Master. That the work he is doing is not his, but it is the work of God, and Paul is just a worker. And the work is to take the Gospel to **ALL NATIONS**. Gospel of Jesus Christ should not bounded by any particular tradition. Not Jewish, not Pentecostal, not Baptist, not even Orthodox or Catholic. Gospel of Jesus Christ has to travel to all nations, all people groups. That's what God desire.

And that is what God appointed Paul to do. And gave him authority which include ALL those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.


### Romans 1:8-12
>⁸First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world.⁹ For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you¹⁰always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last succeed in coming to you.¹¹For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you —¹²that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine.

In this scriptures Paul assures us that he does not favor one group above the other. He says "I thank God for **all of you**. Bringing our attention to what's unites us, rather then what divides. He says **"your faith is proclaimed in all the world"**. What does he mean by that?

### To be christian in Rome
Being devoted Christian in Rome was not an easy task. Unlike other places, in the city of Rome Christians were not in a big favor. Often there were pretty much considered the enemies of the state. So, the churches in Rome had to be strong and devoted in their faith in order to be able to withstand all the troubles that came their way. Both Jews and Gentiles. And this was a common denominator between all believers in Roman Churches and also Paul himself.

We know about many horrible thing Paul had to go through while preaching the Gospel. And I think I'm safe to say that scriptures does not provide a comprehensive list of his "adventures". And also, there were more troubles ahead. That Paul already anticipated. And often apostle were surrendered by those who could not really understand his life, and what he have to go through. You know, when you went through some difficulties in your life. And I'm talking about truly heavy things. People, who understand you the best, and usually people who are able to empathize, comfort and encourage you, usually are those who had similar experiences. And I believe that is what Paul was looking forward too. That's what he is talking about in verses 11 and 12. He have some spiritual gift, the knowledge and revelation that he would gladly share with the church in Rome. And they can truly understand the life Paul lived. They can empathize and support Paul. Because, they would often go though similar experiences.

Paul assuring Romans that they are dear to his heart. That he proud of them and that he consider them mature, so much so that when he comes he anticipates to not only serve and give, but also to receive. To get strengthen and encouraged. He reminds that they share the same faith. Again pointing out to the things that unite, not divide.

### Romans 1:13-15
¹³I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles.¹⁴ I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians,  both to the wise and to the foolish.¹⁵So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.

### Gentiles
In the verses 13 to 17 we can see Paul assuring people in the church that he is not at all avoiding coming to Rome. That the only reason he did not visited them so far were outer obstacles. At the end of the letter he will reveal to us the true reason and nature of what was preventing him. And as much as his desires go. Paul have many times intended to visit Rome. But, God had other plans for him.

Also, we can see that in the beginning of the letter it seems like Paul addressed believers of a Jewish background a little more. You can notice it in the language he uses. Referring to the Holy Scriptures, that had great authority and a lot of weight for Jews. And was way less important for Gentiles. And in this section his language changes a bit. He stats to talk more plainly. Reassuring listeners that in his ministry of preaching the Gospel he not bound by national factor. Level of literacy or wisdom. **Gospel is available for everyone**. It is not privatized by any nation, tradition or the group of people.

### Romans 1:16-17
>¹⁶For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.¹⁷For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.”

### Keys
Verses 16 and 17 are keys to the new view of the world. **"The righteous shall live by faith"**. This is the core of Paul's teaching. This is why we can have a church gathering in the format we understand. This is what set's gospel free of tradition. **...to everyone who believes!**. Both for Jews and Greeks(Gentiles). Please, notice it does not exclude Jews. It does not say that it is only for those Jews who stop following the law, as some people trying to say. No, it is for all who believe in Good News of Jesus Christ.

We can see that two worldviews were merged in this verses. Logic and Holy Scriptures says that Gospel brings salvation to EVERYONE who BELIEVES. To the Jew first BUT also to the Greek.Yes, Gospel came from Jews and though Jews and we cannot and should not discount that. But, the Good news of Jesus Christ did not stop there. It went into the nations. It is for everyone who have faith.

### Application
* We should take a new look at the salvation and appreciate that God was so kind to release it into the nations without the burden of tradition.
* We also should not impose our tradition when we preach the Gospel. Gospel is the Good News about the Jesus Christ, Son of God whom he rose from the dead. And now though Jesus we can have forgiveness of our sins.
* There is place for traditions in every fellowship and there is time to honor those. But let's not bond those to the Gospel. Let's quite looking down on other Christian confessions. And rather take the gospel to the people who actually never heard it.
* There were times when the believers in the church have different views and both parties consider themselves to be right. On our Men's bible studies on Wednesdays, sometimes guys getting very passionate about things, and not always agree with one another.  Which can create room for the enemy to make a division. And split the church. And hurt the work of the Lord. But, instead of claiming to be right, and call out others for being wrong, we should be looking into things that unite us, and not divide. Just as apostle Paul did.
