## Intro
Last time we spent a lot of time looking at the context of the book and less time reading the scriptures. Today we will try to do the opposite. There are still few important historical mentions that we need to consider in order to better understand the application and the meaning of the scriptures. In case you were not here last Sunaday let me quickly summarize what we looked at.

#### Summery of last Sunday
Last time we looked at the historical background of the letter to the church(es) in the city of Rome. We talked about **Saul of Tarsus** and how he relates to the story. We also talked about formation of the church in Rome. And little bit of what the church been going through, what kind of challenges they have experienced at the time of the letter. Today we might expand on that a little more, but before we will do that let's start with our scriptures.

### Romans 1:1-17
>¹Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,²which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,³concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh⁴and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,⁵through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations,⁶including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,

>⁷To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: 

>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.


#### Recap of the verse 1
Just as a recap from the previous Sunday, In the beginning of his letter Paul introduces himself and also provides the prove of his authority and expertise. We figured that Paul indeed have all the authority to speak into the life of the church he did not start. And this letter speaks to us as much as it were to Christians in Rome.

#### Why he talks about Gospel?
Starting from the verse 2 Paul starts to preset the Gospel or the Good News, that he is a servant off. Why would he do that? He writes to the church that exists for a number of years. Church that is active and famous in the Christian circles? There might be several reasons. But I want to focus on the one I believe to be one of the major. And to explain it well I need to start from a far. So, please bear with me for a moment.

Christian movement of the first century were rapidly growing among the Jews as well as among non-Jewish cultures. And that presented a problem that our days we don't even consider. The problem were "what to do with the non Jewish believers?". If you thing about it for the moment, you will see that it was not an easy one. Jesus and his disciples were Jews. There were born in that culture. They followed their tradition like Circumcision, rules about the food, law of Moses, observing the Sabbath and other Religious celebrations. That all was a part of their life. And Jesus never spoke against those things. He never taught people or his disciples that they should stop following their tradition, culture and religion. In fact this is what the Jesus says:

### Matthew 5:17
 ¹⁷ “Do not think that I have come to abolish(destroy) the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.

So, in the minds of Jewish people if anyone would want to come and follow their God. It is possible, but they have to become Jews. Get circumcised, start observing the law and etc. It was pretty standard view. And that is how apostles thought as well. Not because they are bed people. But because that was the only way they knew. They did not even thought that there are other options. And therefore it was a standard position of a Jewish follower of Christ. **If you want to follow Christ. If you want to be a part of this hope. You need to follower everything else as well. You have to be a Jew in regards.** 


So, when the apostle Paul came up with a new way of thinking. Which we will see in the moment. But simply pot it is that salvation comes by the faith alone. It have created controversy among the Jews. Many people did not like the idea. Did not agree with it. And were apposed.

There were talks and rumors about Paul's teaching. Misinterpretation and misrepresentation and attempts to compromise Paul and his words. Not nesseserly because Jewish believers were all that bad. No, simply because those ideas were solidified in their minds. And in his letter Paul takes the opportunity to clarify to the Jewish believers and Gentiles what is this Gospel he is teaching. Not because they did not know Gospel, but to assure them that **His** Gospel is the same Gospel they believed. And he starts to build the foundation to prove his position to be true and illuminate that controversy.


### Romans 1:3-6
³concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh⁴and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,⁵through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations,⁶including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,


In this scriptures we see that yes, Jesus belong to Jewish nation according to the flesh. Exactly like God is promised. But as a Son of God, His authority, mission  and promises expand to all nation. Jesus Christ accepts all people regardless of their nation. National or traditional factor does not matter anymore. What matters is the **obedience of faith**. Gospel of Jesus Christ does not come in a bundle with Jewish(or any other)tradition. We will look into that more in following Sundays. But ultimately salvation comes by **faith**.

### Romans 1:8-12
>⁸First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world.⁹ For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you¹⁰always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last succeed in coming to you.¹¹For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you —¹²that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine.


In this scriptures Paul assures us that he does not favor one group above the other. He says "I thank God for **all of you**. Bringing our attention to what's unites us, rather then what divides. He says **"your faith is proclaimed in all the world"**. What does he mean by that?

### To be christian in Rome
Being devoted Christian in Rome was not an easy task. Unlike other places, in the city of Rome Christians were not in a big favor. Often there were pretty much considered the enemies of the state. So, the churches in Rome had to be strong and devoted in their faith in order to be able to withstand all the troubles that came their way. Both Jews and Gentiles. And this was a common denominator between all believers in Roman Churches and also Paul himself.

We know about many horrible thing Paul had to go through while preaching the Gospel. And I think I'm safe to say that scriptures does not provide a comprehensive list of his "adventures". And there were more troubles ahead. That Paul already anticipated. And often Paul were surrendered by those who could not really understand his life, and what he have to go through. You know, when you had to go through some difficulties in your life. And I'm talking about truly heavy things. People, who would understand you the best, and usually people who would be able to comfort you and encourage you, usually those who had similar experiences. And I believe that is what Paul personally is looking forward too. He have some spiritual gift, I believe that is his knowledge and revelation that he would gladly share with the church in Rome. And they can truly understand the life Paul lived in the very practical sense. Paul were looking at the churches in Rome as a place of comfort and encouragement.

Do you ever were looking into coming to church to get comforted and encouraged? Church should be the place of comfort and encouragement. Not only for those who follow, but also for those who serve. And in order to get the encouragement you need to open up. You need to build relationships with those who around you. Because, it is not about 1.5 hours of the Church Service on Sunday that makes us church. No, it is our relationships with God AND with one another. 

### Romans 1:13-17
¹³I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles.¹⁴ I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians,  both to the wise and to the foolish.¹⁵So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.

>¹⁶For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.¹⁷For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.”

### Gentiles
In the verses 13 to 17 we can see Paul assuring people in the church that he is not at all avoiding coming to Rome. That the only reason he did not visited the so far were outer obstacles. At the end of the letter he will reveal to us the true reason and nature of what was preventing him. And as much as his desires go. Paul have many times intended to visit Rome. But, God had other plans for him.

Also, we can see that in the beginning of the letter Paul mostly addressed believers of a Jewish background. You can notice it in the language he uses. Referring to the Holy Scriptures, that had great authority and a lot of weight for Jews. And had very little for Gentiles. And in this section his language changes a bit. He stats to talk more plainly. Reassuring listeners that in his ministry of preaching the Gospel he not bound by national factor. Level of literacy or wisdom. **Gospel is available for everyone**. It is not privatized by any nation.


verses 16 and 17 are keys to the new view of the world. **"The righteous shall live by faith"**. This is the core of Paul's teaching. This is why we can have a church gathering in the format we and understand. This is what set's gospel free of tradition. **...to everyone who believes!**. Both for Jews and Greeks(Gentiles). Please, notice it does not exclude Jews. It does not say that it is only for those Jews who stop following the law, as some people trying to say. No, it is for all who believe in Good News of Jesus Christ.




### Application

* We should take a new look at the salvation and appreciate that God was so kind to release it into the nations without the burden of tradition.
* We also should not impose our tradition when we preach the Gospel. Gospel is the Good News about the Jesus Christ, Son of God whom he rose from the dead. Though whom we can have forgiveness of our sins.
* There were times when the believers in the church have different views and both parties consider themselves to be right. Which does create room for the enemy to make a division. And split the church. And hurt the work of the Lord. But, instead of claiming to be right, and callout others to be wrong, we should be looking into things that unite us, and not divide.
