## Introduction to the book of Romans

>### Romans 1:1-17
>¬πPaul, a servant  of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,¬≤which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,¬≥concerning his Son, who was descended from David  according to the flesh‚Å¥and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,‚Åµthrough whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations,‚Å∂including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,

>‚Å∑To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: 

>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

>‚Å∏First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world.‚Åπ For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you¬π‚Å∞always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last succeed in coming to you.¬π¬πFor I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you ‚Äî¬π¬≤that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine.¬π¬≥I do not want you to be unaware, brothers,  that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles.¬π‚Å¥ I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians,  both to the wise and to the foolish.¬π‚ÅµSo I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.

>¬π‚Å∂For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.¬π‚Å∑For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith,  as it is written, ‚ÄúThe righteous shall live by faith.‚Äù

We should start from the overview of the book and some historical background. Why? Because it is often unlocks the understanding of why certain things are mentinoned and discussed. How to apply them and so on. Because written word can be tricky. It lacks the emotions and intensions. It has only word and depending on many factors you can read the same words differently. As social networks and messenger apps gained tremendos ammount of popularity, it became apperant.

Many times I found myself in the position where I wrote a little message to someone. Saied something pretty inecent. Maybe a little joke or what not. But, on the other end of the conversation. Person misread it and got hurt. Got very offended. And then I had to deal with a conflict that would have not even taking place if we would talk in person.

So, the context is very, very important. And that is exactly why I like to start any new book of the bible with an overview. And book of Romans not going to be an exception. 

Book of Romans where written by an Apostile Paul. Formerly known as a *Saul of Tarsus*. He were a Jewish rabby. Who passionately observed and followed law of Moses and Jewish traditions. He was one of the brightest teachers of the law of his day. And I think if he would to continue to persue that career, he would easily get to the teepety top. He was extremely smart. Very devoted. His teachers were the best of the best.

However Saul of Tarsus viewed Jesus and His followers as the threat to everything he was so passionate about. And with all his passion he started to go against that movement. Persecuting and destroying the believers and entire communities. Once he largely and sevirely damaged the community of the Followers of Christ in Jerusalem. He went into trouble to get permissions to do the same in the other cities.

His next target was the city of Damascus. And on his way to Damascus he met with the Lord Jesus. It was the encounter that changed his life. He turned from the main enemy of the Gospel to a one of the major Messangers of the Gospel. From being one who were persecuting people for their faith in Jesus Christ, to the one who were persecuted for the same faith.

God have used his knowledge and passion to start Christian Churches all over Roman Empire. He were pretty famous figure. Largely respected in Christian Circles, but also there were people and entire communities who have questioned Paul's authority.

At the time Paul writes his letter to Church in Rome. He did not yet visited this community in person. And even though he known by some of the people who lived in Rome. He was not known by everyone. 

There is no clear how exactly church in Rome were formed but the most common version is that the Jews who were in Jerusalem at the day of Pentecost(Acts XXX) and have repented. Returned back home to Rome and formed the community there. But also I believe that there were those who heared Paul's preaching in different part of the Roman empire. Because, remember places were the Paul went often were trending centers, religious centers or sport centers. And so people who heared the Gospel of Jesus Christ preached by Paul(or by others). Among those  who believed very well might have been some visiters who later returned home and joined their local Christian community.

So Church(or i perhaps should say churches) in Rome were a mix match of Jewish believers and Gentile believers. And at the moment Paul writes his letter church already existed for a number of years. Were active and famous. And unlike other letters of Paul. In his letter to the church in Rome he does not address particular issues or problems they have. He's main goal is to encorage the church. He presents encapsulated version of the Gospel. And expressed hope to not only visit them, but also that they will help him with his further ministry to those who do not know about Christ in Spain.

Even though Paul does not address any particular issues in his letter. He does spent considerable part of his letter helping Jewish and Non-Jewish believers to settle their arguments. We will address this topic once we get there but, short version is that most lickly church have started as primaraly Jewish. And those  non-Jew believers were in minority and were largely overlooked. Due to the Jewish culture and tradition(them being special nation) of the day.

Then under the reign of the emperor XXXX all Jews were expelled from the city of Rome. And were allowed to return only **5 years later**. When they got back to their homes and churches. They have found that at this point church consist primerly of non-Jewish believers and now Jews were overlooked and undervalued. So people in the church with different backgrounds would argue about the traditions and the law. About what should be followed and how things should be. So Paul, as a Jewish rabby on one side and apostile for Gentiles on the other helps them to settle thier arguments and find path of love and peace.
