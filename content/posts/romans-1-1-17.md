### Romans 1:1-17
>¹Paul, a servant  of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,²which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,³concerning his Son, who was descended from David  according to the flesh⁴and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,⁵through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations,⁶including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,

>⁷To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: 

>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

>⁸First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world.⁹ For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you¹⁰always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last succeed in coming to you.¹¹For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you —¹²that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine.¹³I do not want you to be unaware, brothers,  that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles.¹⁴ I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians,  both to the wise and to the foolish.¹⁵So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.

>¹⁶For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.¹⁷For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith,  as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.”
