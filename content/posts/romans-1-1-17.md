## Introduction to the book of Romans

Today we going to open up a new book of the bible. All Scriptures are inspired by God and good for learning. And for the some time we will anchor to the Pauls letter to the church in the city of Rome. But before we will go ahead and dive into the text, we should lay a little foundation that might help us to understand a little better, or a little easier why certain things are talked about and some are not. It is probably not going to revolutionize your view of the text. Even though it might for some, especially if you never considered that before. But it is certainly can help to explain the scriptures. And in some cases prevents misreading.

We will start from the overview of the book and some historical background. Why? Because it is often unlocks the understanding of the certain aspects of the text. How to apply them and so on. Because written word can be tricky. It lacks the emotional context. It is not always clear what was the intentions of the writer and etc. Which otherwise are pretty apparent when you talk face to face. Or if nothing else could be easily clarified just by talking. Unlike the live conversation, letter has only word. And depending on many factors you can read the same words differently. You know as social networks and message apps gained popularity it became very clear. 

Many times I found myself in the position where I wrote a little message to someone. Said something pretty innocent. Maybe a little joke or what not. But, on the other end of the conversation. Person misread it and got hurt. Got very offended. And then you have to deal with a conflict that would have not even happen if we would just talk in person.

So, the context is very, very important. And that is exactly why I typically like to start any new book of the bible with an overview. And book of Romans not going to be an exception. 

Book of Romans where written by an Apostle Paul. Formerly known as a **Saul of Tarsus**. He were a Jewish rabby. Who passionately observed and followed law of Moses and Jewish traditions. He was one of the brightest teachers of the law of his day. And I think if he would to continue to pursue that career, he would easily get to the teepety top of that corporate ladder. He was extremely smart. Very devoted. He knew how to work hard. His teachers were the best of the best. He got it all.

However Saul of Tarsus viewed Jesus and His followers as the threat to everything he was so passionate about. And with all his passion he started to go against that movement, trying to cast it into oblivion. Persecuting and destroying individuals, families and entire communities. Once he largely and severely shattered community of the Followers of Christ in Jerusalem. He went into trouble to get permissions to do the same in the other cities.

His next target were the city of Damascus. And on his way to Damascus he had very dramatic experience. He met with the Lord Jesus. It was an encounter that changed Paul's life. He turned from the main enemy of the Gospel to a one of the major messengers. From being one who were persecuting people for their faith in Jesus Christ, to the one who were persecuted for the same faith.

God have used his knowledge and passion to start Christian Churches all over Roman Empire. He were pretty famous figure. Largely respected in Christian communities. But not everyone looked up to Paul. There were some people and entire communities who have questioned Paul's authority. So, apostle himself had his share of troubles and challenges.

At the time Paul writes his letter to Church in Rome. He did not yet visited this community in person. And even though he were known by some of the people who lived in Rome. He was not known by everyone. 

It is not clear how exactly church in Rome were formed but the most common version is that the Jews who were in Jerusalem at the day of Pentecost(Acts XXX) and have repented. Returned back home to Rome and formed the community there. But also I believe that there were those who have heard Paul's preaching in different part of the Roman empire and then joined local church.

Because, remember places were the Paul went, often were trending centers, religious centers or sport centers. And people who heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ preached by Paul(or by others) could have come from all over the Roman empire and beyond. And among those who believed very well might have been some visitors who later returned home and joined their local Christian community.

So Church(or i perhaps should say churches) in Rome were a mix match of Jewish believers and Gentile believers. And at the moment Paul writes his letter church already existed for a number of years. Were active and famous. And unlike other letters of Paul. In his letter to the church in Rome he does not address particular issues or problems they have. He's main goal is to encorage the church. He presents encapsulated version of the Gospel. And expressed hope to not only visit them, but also that they will help him with his further ministry to those who do not know about Christ in Spain.

Even though Paul does not address any particular issues in his letter. He does spent considerable part of his letter helping Jewish and Non-Jewish believers to settle their arguments. We will address this topic once we get there but, short version is that most lickly church have started as primaraly Jewish. And those  non-Jew believers were in minority and were largely overlooked. Due to the Jewish culture and tradition(them being special nation) of the day.

Then under the reign of the emperor XXXX all Jews were expelled from the city of Rome. And were allowed to return only **5 years later**. When they got back to their homes and churches. They have found that at this point church consist primerly of non-Jewish believers and now Jews were overlooked and undervalued. So people in the church with different backgrounds would argue about the traditions and the law. About what should be followed and how things should be. So Paul, as a Jewish rabby on one side and apostile for Gentiles on the other helps them to settle thier arguments and find path of love and peace.

At the moment of the writing Paul himself located at the city of Corinth, during his third missionary journey. In the city of Corinth believers struggled to respect Paul as an apostile and God's servant. Also, they have struggled with all kids of immoral behaviors and pagan believes. And that is what Paul had to deal with at the time and those factors also could have their influence on the letter to Rome.

### Paul's introduction

So, with all that being said. Let's start reading.

#### Romans 1:1-8
>¹Paul, a servant  of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,²which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,³concerning his Son, who was descended from David  according to the flesh⁴and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,⁵through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations,⁶including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,

>⁷To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: 

>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

Paul starts his letter to the churches of Rome from introduction of himself. As I already mentioned earlied Paul did not started the church in Rome. And therefore people could have questions like WHO IS PAUL? And what he has to do with our fellowship?

When you introduce yourself to a new group of people, that what you usually do. You say your name and then who you are. You present your identity in a very condensed form, in a singular word of a centanse.

When me and my falmily go back home. We often visit different churches and share about our ministry here in Batumi. And that is very regular thing you have to do. You go up on the stage(if it's a church gathering) or you maybe just sit a bit more upright if it is a less formal group. And you say something among the lines "Hello, my name is Viktar. God called me and my wife to be missionaris."

In the conferance inviroment a persone get's up on the stage and says "hi, my name is Tim. I worked at X for the last 10 years. In cyber secyrity departement and today I'm gonna talk about most common volnurabilities in modern web applications."

So, the person presents himself and also presents his credentials. He proves his experties and gives us reasons to respect his oppinions. He proves that he really knows his field. 

Let's see how does apoustol Paul presents himself.

He says: "Hello, I'm Paul and I am a **slave** of the Chris Jesus".

The word "slave" or "servant" as it translated in ESV bible. In original text sounds like "δοῦλος" - [doolos] - which translates as a slave, devoted to another to the disregard of one's own interests.

Paul's fundumental identity that he goes by. The one he presents here in this letter is a slave of Jesus Christ. Paul litterally says I do not belong to myself. I disregarded my own will and I'm fully devoted to the will of my master.

He continue his introduction:

### Romans 1:1
>¹Paul, a servant  of Christ Jesus, **called to be an apostle**, set apart for the gospel of God,

The word *called* translates as **"invited"** or **"divinely selected and appointed"**. So, Paul, been devinely selected to be an apostle. Who is apostle? Apostle is a delegate, messenger, one sent forth with orders.

Here Paul starts to present us his authority. He provides the reasons why we should listen to him. And as you see it is not because he is very smart. Not because he has a PhD. Not because he was taught by the best of the best. Not because he is exceptionally good at all things God's law.None of that. Paul has all those credentials, but he not using thouse as a proof of this experties if you will.

His authority does not come from him. His authority comes from the fact that he is a servant or the slave of the Jesus Christ, who were apointed to be his messenger, special worker. Paul were sent with orders from the master. And whatever Pauls says or does. He does not do on his own behalf. But on the behalf of the one who sent him. Hi disregarded his own will and fully devoted to the will of his Master. So, his authority comes from his belonging to the master.

Imagine, you walking down the street. The day is really good. Sun shining on you, slight wind blows into your face. You go about your bisness enjoing the moment. And then suddenly some guy on the street stats talking to you. You don't really understand what he is saying. You, as a polite persone would, smile and say sorry, I don't have time. And keep walking. The guy behing you demand you to stop, but you not even thinking about it. Happened to me few times. I'm sure some of you have had simmilar expiriance. No problem what so ever.

But let me share with you the other story that happen to me some time ago. Maybe year or two back. Everything was pretty much like in the first case. Nice day, beautiful weather. And the guy... actulay two of them. With the differance being that they had a Police uniform. They asked me to stop and I did. They asked me some questions and I aswered. They've asked me to open my backpack and I obeyed. I did this not because Gocha and Merab told me. No, but because officers Beridze and Kochalidze requested it. While they are on duty they act not on their own behalf, but on the behalf of the state. State grants them authority. And if you do not obey, you gonna get charges pushed against you. Not because you did't listen to Gocha and Merab, no, but because while they on the duty they represent their "master" the state of Georgia. And disobeying them is the same as disobeying their master. 

Same with apostle Paul. In whatever he does. He does not represents himslelf. He does not speak of himself. He is apointed by the master to do the work. And as long as he is on duty, you should listen to what he is saying. Because disobeying him is the same as disobeying the master who sent him.

Why it is important? Why we spend some much time talking about things that at the first look are not important and obvious.

Because, back in the day, as well as now there are people who doubds Pauls authority. People saying that you should only obey things that Jesus spoke himself, but whatever apostles sayed is not so important, they could have been wrong. They are just people after all.

Yes, they were just regular, everyday people. But those pepole were selected and apointed by God to speak on his behalf. God grants them authority and we should listen and submit. Because, apostles on duty spoke on behalf of God. And all that is written in the bible were inspired by the Holy Spirit. All scripture are good and inspired by God bible says. So, please, do not get trapped by the enemy, by your pride that says "You know better then them". "You need no man to teach you". It will set you up for the falure. 

Not only Pual is chosen by God to be his worker. But also he is not just any worker. Like a multitytool. He is a special instrument. Dedicated to one job.

### Romans 1:1
 ¹Paul, a servant  of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, **set apart for the gospel of God**,

I love tools. I have a few. I know how to work with my hand and fix things, or at least I manage to make them less broken then they were before. And I have this nice multitool. It's not a cheap knockoff. It's a legit one. It's a present from a friend. Solid, made in USA all that. And it does work. It is a handy thing. can be a knife, a saw, a pliers, screwdriver and more. But the moment you need to do something tiny bit more special that regular task, it not gonna help. As good as it is it's going to be useless. But, I have other tools that are highly specialized. And I keep them in the box until the moment I need them. Because, when I need them nothing else will help. Yes, maybe they do one thing, but they do that one thing soooo goood. 

Apostle Paul is like that highly specialized tool. God apointed him to a very specific job. To bring the Gospel to Gentiles. To me and you. So, we as non jewish believers should pay extra attention to what the Paul says. Because, God apointed him to be a messenger specifically to us.


<!--COMMENT: Practicality of this message? What do we learned for our day to day life?

* We layed the foundation for our further study which is important. Because you can't build a strong building if your foundation is weak.
* We assured that Paul and other apostles have authority to speak into our life. And that all bible is good and true. If today you selectively belive the bible, you should repent.
