### INTRO
Good evening friends. If you are new here, my name is Viktar. And it's an honor and privilege for me to be with you tonight. I promise not to take too long so that we can continue our celebration. We've been preparing for this day for a while now. Putting a lot of thought and effort. Decorating our hall. Preparing musical items for our little concert. Preparing presents for the friends and family in our homes. For many of us Christmas season is quite busy time. Which can be stressful as well. So, I would really what us now to take a moment and slow down a little and bring our attention back to the core, to the very reason for this celebration.

### Q:
What do you mean go back to the core?

Well... Christmas as we know it today is relatively new. It's only around 100 years ago Christmas took the form we all know. It became widely celebrated even among non religious people. And it was not a result of the great revival, spiritual awakening. It was not about people coming back to God. Back to the bible. No. None of that. It had nothing to do with faith in God at all.

**Christmas revolution** if you will had much more pragmatic reasons. For the most part big companies and stores simply wanted to sell more product. You can read about it online. But simplified version would sound like that:

Until 1900 Christmas was about remembering Christ’s birth. Families gathered, prayed, shared simple meals, and focused on gratitude, love, and generosity.

But after the 1930's when Santa Clause came around. Everything changed. Christmas is often about shopping, gifts, decorations, and sales. The focus shifts to spending money, meeting expectations, and creating a “perfect” holiday.

Christmas is not centered around Jesus anymore. Christmas without Christ is a reality for many. A lot of people in this world, in this very city will soon celebrate Christmas. Whether it's on 25th of December, or 7th of January. We will decorate our houses. Put up our Christmas trees. Cook special food, buy presents. Invite our friends and family. We will celebrate! But how many of us will celebrate Jesus?

### It asks for a story...
Here in Calvary Chapel we believe in Jesus. God who came down to earth. He is our Lord and Savior. And it's not just words. We are not about being religious. We pursue living faith. That's why we should take Christmas seriously. And not just rush through this season using it as an excuse to treat ourselves and our loved once with something special.

### Story?
Imagine your wife's birthday is coming up. And I'll be like, honey it is your birthday! It is so cool. Finally! I've been counting days! You must be so happy!

You know what I did this year? Because I love you so much, I have decided to treat myself and bought a new phone. I've been saving for the whole year.

Also, I'll go bowling with my buddies. They have suggested to go to a restaurant afterwords, I think I'll join. It is your birthday after all! It should be a special. It should create memories.

**new phone rings**

"Guys are already here to pick me up"

Ok. I gotta go. Have a good one. 
By!


... Love you! ...


### Connection
First of all. This is NOT a marital advice. Please, don't try this at home. Otherwise you risk to indeed create a memories you will never forget.


That's why for the last few weeks we've talked about Jesus's birth . About Christ as a message of Peace, Joy and Hope which we find in God. And how they are different from what you can have in life without God.

We've been lighting up this candles every time we would discover one of this topics because... Well, mostly because it looks cool and because kids love it :) There is nothing secret or sacred about this candles. So, without further a do let's light up our last candle, which is candle of love.

### Message of Love

### John 3:16
 ¹⁶“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.

The birth of Jesus is the message of Love of God to people. Yes, Jesus came to save us. But also he came to teach us about Love. To show us what God is like. That He is a loving Father. He is Love. It is His nature. 

Jesus was born because "God so loved the world..." In other words. God loved me and you so much, that he decided to step in and save us. So that **WE** would have eternal life.

This shows us the attitude of God to us. And it is love all the way. He loves us so much more than we can imagine. Definitely more then we deserve. 

### Application
God so loved **YOU**. That He gave His only Son, so that **YOU** would not perish but have eternal life. Think about it... Isn't it beautiful?

Notice that all the efforts are on the God's side. All the benefits is on your side. How it is possible? It can be hard to accept. Because, we are so used to the way of "selfish" love. Which seeks to receive. That it makes it hard for us to accept "selfless" love of God for us.

Birth of Jesus is a greatest gift for you and me. God gave us His Son. In order to adopt us into His family. Again, all the work on the God's side, and all the benefits on our side. Why? Because God so love the world.

### John 3:17
¹⁷For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him.

>"...Jesus revealed the heart of God the Father in sending God the Son; to bring salvation — rescue, hope, healing — to the world through Him." David Guzik



### When we love
Because when we love we do irrational things. Things that do not submit to logic. Things that sometimes make no sense. 


### Luke 2:4-20
⁴Now Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,⁵in order to register along with Mary, who was betrothed to him, and was pregnant.⁶While they were there, the time came for her to give birth.⁷And she gave birth to her firstborn son; and she wrapped Him in cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.

 ⁸In the same region there were *some* shepherds staying out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock at night.⁹And an angel of the Lord *suddenly* stood near them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened.¹⁰And *so* the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the people;¹¹for today in the city of David there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.¹²And this *will be* a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.”¹³And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army *of angels* praising God and saying,

 ¹⁴“Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace among people with whom He is pleased.”

 ¹⁵When the angels had departed from them into heaven, the shepherds *began* saying to one another, “Let’s go straight to Bethlehem, then, and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.”¹⁶And they came in a hurry and found their way to Mary and Joseph, and the baby as He lay in the manger.¹⁷When they had seen *Him,* they made known the statement which had been told them about this Child.¹⁸And all who heard it were amazed about the things which were told them by the shepherds.¹⁹But Mary treasured all these things, pondering them in her heart.²⁰And the shepherds went back, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as had been told them.
