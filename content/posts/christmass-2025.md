### INTRO
Good evening friends. If you are new here, my name is Viktar. And it's an honor and privilege for me to be with you tonight. I promise not to take too long so that we can continue our celebration. We've been preparing for this day for a while now. Putting a lot of thought and effort. Decorating our hall. Preparing musical items for our little concert. Preparing presents for the friends and family in our homes. For many of us Christmas season is quite busy time. Which can be stressful as well. So, I would really what us now to take a moment and slow down a little and bring our attention back to the core, to the very reason for this celebration.

### Q:
What do you mean go back to the core?

Well... Christmas as we know it today is actually relatively new. It's only around 100 years ago Christmas took the form we all know. It became widely celebrated even among non religious people. And it was not a result of the great revival, spiritual awakening. It was not about people coming back to God. Back to the bible. No. None of that. It had nothing to do with faith in God at all.

**Christmas revolution** if you will had much more pragmatic reasons. For the most part big companies and stores simply wanted to sell more product. You can read about it online. But simplified version would sound like that:

Until 1900 Christmas was about remembering Christ’s birth. Families gathered, prayed, shared simple meals, and focused on gratitude, love, and generosity.

But after the 1930's when Santa Clause came around. Everything changed. Christmas is often about shopping, gifts, decorations, and sales. The focus shifts to spending money, meeting expectations, and creating a “perfect” holiday.

Christmas is not centered around Jesus anymore. Christmas without Christ is a reality for many. A lot of people in this world, in this very city will soon celebrate Christmas. Whether it's on 25th of December, or 7th of January. We will decorate our houses. Put up our Christmas trees. Cook special food, buy presents. Invite our friends and family. We will celebrate! But how many of us will celebrate Jesus?

### It asks for a story...
Here in Calvary Chapel we believe in Jesus. God who came down to earth. He is our Lord and Savior. And it's not just words. We are not about being religious. We pursue living faith. That's why we should take Christmas seriously. And not just rush through this season using it as an excuse to treat ourselves and our loved once with something special.

### Story?
Imagine your wife's birthday is coming up. And I'll be like, honey it is your birthday! It is so cool. Finally! I've been counting days! You must be so happy!

You know what I did this year? Because I love you so much, I have decided to treat myself and bought a new phone, new gaming console and new fishing rods! Isn't that just a best day ever? I've been saving for the whole year.

Also hun, I'll go bowling with my buddies. They have suggested to go to a restaurant afterwords, I think I'll join. It is your birthday after all! It should be a special. It should create memories.

**new phone rings**

"Oh, Guys are already here to pick me up"

Ok. I gotta go. Have a good one. 
By!

... Love you! ...


### Connection
First of all. This is NOT a marital advice. Please, don't try this at home. Otherwise you risk to indeed create a memories you will never ever forget.

But this is exactly how many people celebrate Christmas. Paying no attention to Jesus. Focusing entirely on themselves.


That's why for the last few weeks we've been talking about Jesus's birth. We looked at the birth of Christ as a message of Peace, Joy and Hope for all people. Reflecting on the true meaning of Christmas. Which is about savior being born.

We've been lighting up this candles every time we would discover one of this topics because... Well, mostly because it looks cool and because kids love it :) There is nothing secret or sacred about this candles. So, without further a do let's light up our last candle, which is candle of love.

### Message of Love

### John 3:16
 ¹⁶“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.

The birth of Jesus is the message of Love of God to people. Yes, Jesus came to save us. But also he came to teach us about Love. To show us what God is like. That He is a loving Father. He is Love. It is His nature. 

Jesus was born because "God so loved the world..." In other words. God loved me and you so much, that he decided to step in and save us. So that **WE** would have eternal life.

This shows us the attitude of God towards man. And it is love all the way. He loves us so much more than we can imagine. Definitely more then we deserve. 

### Application
God so loved **YOU**. That He gave His only Son, so that **YOU** would not perish but have eternal life. Think about it... Isn't it beautiful?

Notice that all the efforts are on the God's side. All the benefits are on your side. How it is possible? It can be hard to accept. Hard to believe. We tend to think that we should do something to earn God's love, His favor. We should prove that we deserve it. We should be good people and all that. Because, we are so used to "selfish" or "self centered" love. Which one way or the other, but still seeks to receive. There are so little examples of "selfless" love in our world today. That it makes it hard for us to accept "selfless", "unconditional" love of God.

Birth of Jesus is a greatest gift for you and me. God gave us His Son. In order to adopt us into His family. Again, all the work on the God's side, and all the benefits on our side. Why? Because God so love the world.

>"...Jesus revealed the heart of God the Father in sending God the Son; to bring salvation — rescue, hope, healing — to the world through Him." - David Guzik

Today I want to invite you to ponder about this. And reflect back on God's love during the Christmas season. 

### John 3:16
 ¹⁶“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.

And if you want to know more about God's love. If the phrase "personal relationships with God" is not something that applies to your life, but you wish it would. You can come and talk to me afterwords. 

As for now. I invite you to say couple words in prayer expressing our gratitude for the love of God given to us.
