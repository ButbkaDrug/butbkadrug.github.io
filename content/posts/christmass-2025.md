### INTRO

Good evening, friends. If you are new here, my name is Viktar. It is an honor and a privilege for me to be with you tonight.

I promise I will not take too long, so we can continue our celebration.

We have been preparing for this day for a while now. We put a lot of thought and effort into it. We decorated our hall. We prepared musical pieces for our little concert. We prepared presents for our friends and family at home.

For many of us, the Christmas season is a very busy time. It can be stressful as well.

So now, I would really like us to take a moment, slow down a little. Bringing our attention back to the core — the very reason for this celebration.


### Q:

What do you mean by going back to the core?

Well…

Christmas, as we know it today, is actually quite new. Only about 100 years ago, Christmas took the form we all know. It became widely celebrated, even among non-religious people.

And this was not the result of a great revival or spiritual awakening. It was not about people coming back to God. Back to the Bible. No. None of that. It had nothing to do with faith in God.



The Christmas revolution, if you will, had much more pragmatic reasons.

For the most part, big companies and stores simply wanted to sell more products. You can read about it online. But a simplified version would sound like this:

Until 1900, Christmas was about remembering Christ’s birth. Families gathered, prayed, shared simple meals, and focused on gratitude, love, and generosity.

But after the 1930s, when Santa Claus came around, everything changed.

Christmas became more about shopping, gifts, decorations, and sales. The focus shifted to spending money, meeting expectations, and creating a “perfect” holiday.

Christmas is no longer centered around Jesus. Christmas without Christ is a reality for many people. A lot of people in this world, in this very city, will soon celebrate Christmas. Whether it is on the 25th of December or the 7th of January.

* We will decorate our houses.
* We will put up our Christmas trees.
* We will cook special food and buy presents.
* We will invite our friends and family.
* We will celebrate!

**But how many of us will celebrate Jesus?**


### Preparing for story...
Here in Calvary Chapel we believe in Jesus. God who came down to earth. He is our Lord and Savior. And it's not just words. We are not about being religious. We pursue living faith. That's why we should take Christmas seriously. And not just rush through this season using it as an excuse to treat ourselves and our loved once with something special.

### Story?
Imagine your wife's birthday is coming up.

And I'll be like, "Honey, it's your birthday! This is so cool. Finally! I've been counting the days! You must be so happy! I am sooooo happpppyyy!!!"

You know what I did this year? Because I love you so much, I decided to treat myself. I bought a new phone, a new gaming console, and new set of fishing rods! Isn't that the best day ever? I've been saving all year.

Also, hun, I'll go bowling with my buddies. They suggested going to a restaurant afterwards, and I think I'll join. It's your birthday after all! It should be special. It should create memories.

**new phone rings**

"Oh, guys are already here to pick me up"

Okay. I gotta go. Have a good one.  
Bye!

... Love you! ...


### Connection
First of all, this is NOT marital advice. Please don't try this at home. Otherwise, you risk creating memories you will never forget indeed.

As weird as this example is, this is exactly how many people celebrate Christmas, paying no attention to Jesus and focusing entirely on themselves.

That's why, for the last few weeks, we've been talking about Jesus’ birth. We looked at the birth of Christ as a message of peace, joy, and hope for all people, reflecting on the true meaning of Christmas, which is about the Savior being born.

We've been lighting up these candles every time we discover one of these topics because... Well, mostly because it looks cool and kids love it :) There is nothing secret or sacred about these candles. So, without further ado, let's light up our last candle, which is the candle of love.


### Message of Love

### John 3:16
 ¹⁶“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.

The birth of Jesus is the message of God’s love to people. Yes, Jesus came to save us. But he also came to teach us about love. To show us what God is like. That he is a loving Father. **He is love**.

Jesus was born because "God so loved the world..." In other words, God loved me and you so much that he decided to step in and save us. So that **we** would have eternal life.

This shows us God’s attitude towards us. And it is love all the way. He loves us so much more than we can imagine. Definitely more than we deserve.

### Application
God so loved **you** that he gave his only Son, so that **you** would not perish but have eternal life. Think about it… Isn't it beautiful?

Notice that all the effort is on God’s side. All the benefits are on your side. How is it possible? It is hard to believe. Hard to accept.

We tend to think we should do something to earn God’s love and favor. We should prove we deserve it. If we were good people, followed all the rules, and all that,  maybe then we would believe…

Because we are so used to "selfish" or "self-centered" love, which, one way or another, still seeks to receive. Even when giving away.

There are so few examples of true "selfless" love in our world today. That makes it hard for us to accept the "selfless" and "unconditional" love of God.

The birth of Jesus is the greatest gift for you and me. God gave us his Son so that through Him we would be adopted into His family.

Again, all the work is on God’s side, and all the benefits are on our side.  

**Why?** - Because **God so loved the world.**

>"...Jesus revealed the heart of God the Father in sending God the Son; to bring salvation — rescue, hope, healing — to the world through Him." - David Guzik

Today I want to invite you to ponder this and reflect on God’s love during the Christmas season.

### John 3:16
 ¹⁶“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.

And if you want to know more about God’s love, if the phrase "personal relationship with God" is not something that applies to your life but you wish it did, you can come and talk to me afterwards.  

For now, let's say a couple of words in prayer, expressing our gratitude for the love of God given to us.
