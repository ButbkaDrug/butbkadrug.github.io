### INTRO
Good evening friends. If you are new here, my name is Viktar. And it's an honor for me to be able to speak to you tonight. I promise not to take too long so that we can continue our celebration. We've been preparing for this day for a while. Putting a lot of thought and effort.Preparing musical items for our evening. Preparing presents for the friends and family. For many of us Christmas season is quite busy time. That can be stressful as well. So, I would really what us now to take a moment and slow down a little and bring our attention back to the core, to the very reason for Christmas.

Because the Christmas as we know it today is relatively new. It's only about 100 years ago Christmas took the form we all know and love. And it was not the result of the revival, spiritual awakening among believers. It was not about bringing us back to God. Back to the bible. No. None of that. It was not connected with faith in God at all.

**Christmas revolution** if you will had much more pragmatic reasons. For the most part it was that big companies and stores simply wanted to sell more product. You can read more in depth about it online. But simplified version would be that. Until 1900 Christmas was about remembering Christ’s birth. Families gathered, prayed, shared simple meals, and focused on gratitude, love, and generosity.

But after the Santa Clause came around in 1930's Christmas is often about shopping, gifts, decorations, and sales. The focus shifts to spending money, meeting expectations, and creating a “perfect” holiday.

Christmas is not centered around Jesus anymore. A lot of people in this world, in this very city will soon celebrate Christmas. Whether it's on 25th of December, or 7th of January. We will decorate our houses. Pull out our Christmas trees. Cook special food, buy presents. Invite our friends and family. We will celebrate! But do we remember what do we celebrate? Or rather WHO we celebrate?
