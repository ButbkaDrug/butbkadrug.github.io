### INTRO
Greeting brothers and sisters, we are back to our regular study. To the book of Romans in case you wonder. At this point we are *at the finish line*. There are about 1,5 chapters left. And today we going to continue with the chapter 15. 

We had a "Christmas break" for a few weeks. When we switched off the book of Romans. In order to prepare our hearts and reflect on the birth of Christ. **But now we're so back!**

We stopped at the verse 20. And initially my plan for today was to pick up from there. And to talk about the missions. Reaching out the unreached, supporting missionaries. About our responsibility in all this. Important things. And we ARE going to talk about it for sure. But probably not today.

### Topic
Because as I started to prepare. Praying and reading scriptures. Something else was brought to my attention in this chapter. Something that honestly I did not really planned to talk about. But for some reason kept feeling convicted that we **should** talk about it. So, let's do it.

Let's rewind a few verses back to where the Apostle Paul talks about his mission. He provides some more reasons why he wrote this letter, as well as his standing to address the situation in that church.

### Context
Remember Paul did not established church in Rome. In fact he have never visited them. So, even though Paul was well known figure in Christian circles of the first century. He was not a part of that church. In a way he was a stranger. An outsider.

By the time Paul writes his letter. Church in Rome was functioning for at least a decade. Or even two. If you really think about it people in the church were following Christ for as long as Paul. So, one can very reasonably say:

"Hey, Paul. We've been doing church for two decades now. And you never been part of it. We have our leaders. We have Holy Spirit in us as well. So, by what authority do you write this to us? What prompted you to write this letter? 

And we must admit that those are legitimate questions and concerns. 

Understanding that Paul writes following:

### Romans 15:14
>¹⁴And concerning you, my brothers *and sisters,* I myself also am convinced that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able also to admonish one another.

>¹⁵But I have written very boldly to you on some points so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given to me from God,

>¹⁶**to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles**, ministering as a priest the gospel of God...

<!--FIX: Need to think more about this one  -->
In other words he says:"It's not because you can't figure it out without me. I bet you can. But, because it is my responsibility before God to make sure you actually get it right... I know I'm a stranger to you, but this is why you can trust me...".

Apostle Paul deserve trust. Because he is a minister of **Christ Jesus**. Which means that **what he says and does. He does on behalf of Jesus**. Whatever goal he pursue is not of his own. But of His master.

It means that He is not after his own agenda. But he is seeking to do the job God trusted him with.

Paul had a unique role. He was appointed by God. In a very unique, very dramatic way. He had a special mission and responsibility. To bring the Gospel of Christ to the Gentiles(non Jewish people). And authority that he had was unique too.

Unlike regular pastor, leader or any kind of minister in the church. When your authority AND responsibility bound by the very concrete group of people or specific location that God trusted you with. Paul's authority and responsibility span over multiple churches and regions.

### Romans 15:18-19
>¹⁸For I will not presume to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me, resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed,

>¹⁹in the power of **signs** and **wonders**, in the **power of the Spirit**; so that from Jerusalem and all around as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.

Paul presents the fruit of his ministry. Proof of his validity. Proof that he is a real deal. That God is with Him. And it is not just all talk.

### Actual Topic
Now we are coming to a heart of what we are going to talk about today.

**Why is this verification needed? Why he is saying all this?**

### Example
In our days **verification** is a regular part of our life. You verify your credentials multiple times a day without even thinking about it:

You want to unlock your phone -> you have to through verification
You want to open you email -> you have to go through verification
You open your banking app -> you have to go though verification

Even to enter my building I have to go over verification too!

Basically, verification is when You need to prove that you can be trusted.

### Connection
And when you let someone to speak into your life. To influence you. I think it is very sensitive area. That requires verification. Especially when person claim to operate on behalf of God.

You want to be sure that this person is trustworthy. That he knows what he is doing. And that he is not pursuing his own goals.

That's why verification is necessary. Even when it came to Apostle Paul back in the day. Because in a new testament time, and it is still true to this day, there were a lot of false teachers, false prophets, self proclaimed leaders, "influencers" as we call them today.

People who cover up their hidden motives with "Christian like" narrative. People who have their own ambitions, their own agenda. Who pursue their own gals. Who try to **use the church of God for their own purposes**.

And Paul was no stranger to such problem. He had to deal with this kind of people damaging the church more then once. 

But even before Paul, Jesus Himself warns us about that kind of people:

### Matthew 7:15-16
>¹⁵“Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.¹⁶You will know them by their fruits...

People can be very deceiving. They can fool you and me. They can put on fake christian character and be very believable. So much so that you cannot tell who is who until you see the fruit. The results of their actions. Results of their influence. We can see examples of it in the new testament:

### 3 John 1:9,10
>⁹I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not accept what we say.¹⁰For this reason, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with malicious words; and not satisfied with this, he himself does not receive the brothers either, and he forbids those who want *to do so* and puts *them* out of the church.

Sounds very bad to me. And also there is another one:

### 2 Corinthians 11:13-15
>¹³These people are false apostles. They are deceitful workers who disguise themselves as apostles of Christ.¹⁴But I am not surprised! Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.¹⁵So it is no wonder that his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. In the end they will get the punishment their wicked deeds deserve.

### Reality
This is real. It have happened then. It still happening today. In big churches. In small churches. Even in our own church we already have experienced that. When person come, they smile into your face. They say nice things, presenting the best version of themselves. On Sundays, during the small groups. All throughout the week.

They know all the right answers. They know right words to say. Probably can quote scriptures upon scriptures. They are supportive and charismatic. And when you look at them you think to yourself:

>"Gosh, this person is way better them me. I don't know bible nearly as well. I have issues with my character. But this guy/girl is perfect. Perfect follower of Christ. How come He is not the pastor or something..."

But then... As we figured later. At the same time this very person engaged in behind-the-scenes maneuvering trying to achieve their own goals. Promote their agenda. And it all came out almost on an accident.

### Disclaimer
Just to be clear. It's been few years since then. And this person is not here anymore. Or maybe He is. I won't tell)))

This kind of people go around approaching church members in private saying things like "Let's start our own church. Our own group. They say "leaders are not bad people they just wrong. We can do so much better."

This church have problems... It missing this and that... Pastor don't let anyone else to serve in this church and etc."

And you know... By serving they don't mean vacuuming, cleaning toilets or doing dishes... They usually mean "they didn't make me a church leader on the day we met"

It's a real problem that still exist. Maybe it is happening right now. I'm not gonna know. Because such people not going to come to me. They gonna go to you.

It is especially challenging in the setting like ours. When we have new people joining our fellowship every week. And then on one hand you want to encourage people to serve, to edify one another. And on the other hand you want to prevent "ravenous wolves", as Jesus called them,  from having a go.

### Back to Paul
So, even though apostle Paul was important man of God in general. For this particular church he was an outsider.

And therefore he did not hesitated to provide a prove that his motivation is pure. That he doesn't pursue his own goals. He only concerned about what His master appointed him to do.

He proves that he CAN BE TRUSTED.

### Application
What is the lesson for us today? I think the biggest takeaway is that we should stay alert. And not let enemy destroy the work of God in this city. In our church.

And this word is not only for the leaders. It is for every one of us. Whether it is your first time here. Or you've been here from the day 1. Regardless whether you'll stay here for a month or for years to come. We should take ownership and help this church to be, what God want's us to be. 

Which includes protecting our own heart, and our brothers and sister. Especially those who new to faith. Those who on their way to believing. Those who are weak from false prophets, false apostles. From ravenous wolfs. 

### Red flag
And if you wonder, how would I know? I mean I'm new here and all that.

Good point. I'll give you one universal sign. There is more. But this one works pretty much ever time. Huge red flag that will signal you that something is not right. It is when people suggests or starts doing something **in secret**. Bypassing church leadership.

### John 10:1,2
>¹“I tell you the truth, anyone who sneaks over the wall of a sheepfold, rather than going through the gate, must surely be a thief and a robber!²But the one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.

This church belong to God. It is HIS sheepfold. And no one who comes from God should *sneak over the wall*.

If you are not ready to enter *through the gates*. Well, maybe then just stay outside. There is no place for plotting, for "pulling the strings" or intriguing in this Church.

If you have genuine concern about something. That you think we doing wrong go the leaders. Go to a pastor and present your concerns there. Openly.

But If instead you are going around the church sabotaging the work of God. Please, Stop. You are not serving the Lord. You are serving your ego. And as the Paul says *"In the end they will get the punishment their wicked deeds deserve."*

I mean go do something else. You not gonna win this game. In the end God will be the winner anyway.

### Your part
On the other hand. In case someone comes to you and start to make you doubt your church. Leaders, pastor whatever. You don't have to listen to that. In fact you should not listen to them. Because it will affect you, your faith, your attitude.

I really liked the response of one of the people who had experienced that situation from few years ago. When he was approached like that, in secret He replied with:

"If you have real concerns. Let's go to the pastor together and talk them through..." 

Don't let seeds of the doubt to grow in your heart. This is how the enemy work. Right from the beginning. When someone comes to you and tries to makes you doubt your faith, your church, your church leaders. They are not concerned about you. Your success, your spiritual growth.

They only concerned about themselves. Their own agenda. Their own success.

Working like that, in secret, Is never the God's way. This is how the enemy works. 

### Conclusion

So wrapping up. We should stay alert in our minds and in our spirit. And not to let enemy destroy or damage the work of God.

Even apostle Paul understood that. And set the example for us. He openly addressed the Church. Layed out everything he had on his mind. And allowed them to decide whether they will accept him or not. Whether they will support his mission. He entered though the gates.

### John 10:1,2
>¹“I tell you the truth, anyone who sneaks over the wall of a sheepfold, rather than going through the gate, must surely be a thief and a robber!²But the one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.
