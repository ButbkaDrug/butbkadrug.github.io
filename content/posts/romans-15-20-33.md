### INTRO
Greetings church, even though it felt like we were done with our book last Sunday, today we are still in Romans. We skipped a small, but very important part of the previous chapter. So, let's go back and revisit few verses.

### MISSIONS
We will be reading form the Romans 15. And talk about missionary work.

I think today is a perfect Sunday to do that. We have visiting team of missionaries from Tbilisi with us. They will be serving with us and will be a blessing for our church for some time. We have also heard from Matt about their missionary work for the Lord. Reaching out the "unreached". Praise God!

So, I think I'm not going to be wrong if I'll say that quite a few people in our church are passionate about missions. It's definitely true for me and my wife. We are no strangers to mission. It's been our life for the last 15 years and we still pursuing this path. It's the best job in the world [MEME https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_ts9DSIh0g]

### WHY?
But no one get's born with an understanding of the God's heart for mission. There were time when I had no idea. There is no shame in it. I didn't see my place and role in mission. I didn't understand my responsibility. I didn't even know that there is a responsibility! I've though that  **"a missionary"** is the thing of the past! Dead profession. Like **Lamblighters** and **Knocker-Upers**[IMG https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*O6NY4iNjTxh494-9oZTemg.jpeg] If you never heard about them, they would go around the city and wake people up in the morning by knocking on their window or a door. So that people could go to work in time. But then alarm clock was invented and this profession became a obsolete.

And today this profession, even though it was important at some point in time, now dead. And turned into history, a hobby for some. Today you not gonna find professional Kncker-uper. In the modern world we call such people - neighbors. And most often they use the drill to wake you up first thing on Sunday morning. :)

Anyway. This type of thinking is an unfortunate reality for many Christians. Who think that a missionaries became obsolete. Due to the technical progress or some other reasons. Maybe that how you think as well. Just as myself few years back... Well, fine... a bit more then *few* years. More like 2 decades back. But anyway.

Today I want to bring biblical perspective into our attention. I want us to remember. To understand that mission is not dead. It's still relevant. And will continue to be relevant until Jesus comes back. Actually more accurate is to say that, **WHEN** we will fulfill this mission, **THEN** Jesus will come back.

Unfortunately we not going to be able to have a comprehensive look on missions in the bible tonight. We will only have a brief glimpse. "*Touch on few things*, so to speak". We will explore what is our responsibility as a church in regards of mission. Let's start reading:

### Romans 15:20-23
²⁰And in this way I aspired to preach the gospel, not where Christ was *already* known by name, so that I would not build on another person’s foundation;²¹but just as it is written: 

“THEY WHO HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD ABOUT HIM WILL SEE, AND THEY WHO HAVE NOT HEARD WILL UNDERSTAND.”

 ²²For this reason I have often been prevented from coming to you;

### PAUL - PIONEER
In this verses Paul briefly talk about his role, his vision and his attitude towards the work of the Gospel. He explains why he is always on the move. And have never settled anywhere. Why he never became a pastor of the church or something? Even though he started so many.

He quotes prophet Isaiah in the verse 21 to defend his position. As an argument and explanation. It shows that it was not just Paul's idea. We was not perusing desire to travel around the area or something. He simply obeyed the scriptures:

### Isaiah 52:15
¹⁵And he will startle many nations. Kings will stand speechless in his presence. For they will see what they had not been told; they will understand what they had not heard about.

### HIS APPROACH
Today we would call apostle Paul a "pioneer", a church planter. The person who reaches out to the "unreached". Areas and people groups that never heard the Gospel. That have no church. That have no opportunity to hear the Good News.

Which is actually God's dream. You can find it in many places of the bible. New and Old testament. But, my favorite and the most concise description is in 1 Timothy:

### 1 Timothy 2:4
...**all people** to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

Heart of God stretches to every single person. Regardless of their nation, social status, financial well being etc. Jesus made this clear. He lead the way, so to speak. And Paul became one of the first workers to implement this idea. God called Paul to take the Gospel to Gentiles specifically, which was unheard of.

Until God called Paul. No one ever even considered that Gospel needs to be taken to all nations. Remember that it was at the time when wast majority of follower of Christ were Jews. And quite a few of them believed that salvation is not for Gentiles. They had to have a special meeting, a council. When the apostles gather to decided whether Gentiles can be saved. But, we not gonna go into that, it's just to bring a little bit of the perspective.

### FIRST MISSIONARY
I would consider Apostle Paul as a fist missionary of the new testament. At least the one that is well known. The one who focused specifically on taking the Gospel to those who never heard. Who have no Idea. His type of ministry was new and "out of the box" he had to prove that it's actually biblical.

### PAUL'S EXAMPLE
Apostle Paul sets an example for us. That we should focus on reaching out the unreached. To go into the nations and areas that have no local church. To go into communities which never heard the Gospel. And give them chance to be saved. And tell them that God loves them. God still calling people. We can go back to the prophet Isaiah:

### Isaiah 6:8
 ⁸Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?” Then I said, “Here am I. Send me!”

This words are still relevant. God is still looking for workers. Who will be willing to say "Here am I. Send Me!".

### Called to Go
There are people who are called to go. This is the will of God. And I know that we have such people in this room. People who read this verses and they resonate with your hearts. And this is great! This is how it should be!

When we read the bible we see that all of us, every single one, should be the messenger of the Gospel. But also we see that not everyone will choose mission as their **profession**, as a life style. And that's what defines a missionary. Is the one who chose mission work as their profession. Who've been sent, released by the church. This is what we find in scriptures.

But as for majority of us, we will probably stay home in church. So, what about us, those who stay, who continue to go to the church and serve God locally? What is my role in all this mission business?

### TOPIC
And this is exactly what we will focus on tonight. Apostle Paul writes his letter to the church in Rome. To the regular people who love the Lord. Go to work. Go to church. You know, mere mortals. Just like me and you. So, whatever we find in this letter easily applies to us. Let's read from the verse 23:

### Romans 15:23-33
 ²³but now, with no further place for me in these regions, and since I have had for many years a longing to come to you²⁴whenever I go to Spain — for I hope to see you in passing, and to be helped on my way there by you, when I have first enjoyed your company for a while

### Help to those who go
The key phrase for this section in our context today is **"to be helped by you on my way there(Spain)"**. Paul expresses hope that church in Rome will support him in his next mission trip. That they will help him to take the Gospel to Spain.

Apostle Paul find it appropriate to request help support from the church. He invites Romans, and remember he had no connection with this church beforehand, to join Him in his mission to Spain. To invest their resources into this work. 

### Propempo
When he says "*I hope to be helped*" by you, he uses the Greek word "propempo".

> πρό (pro) = before / forward

> πέμπω (pempō) = to send

> propempō = to send forward

In the New Testament, propempō often includes:

* Providing food

* Providing money

* Providing travel help

* Showing respect and blessing

* Making sure the person lacks nothing for the journey

Simply put:

> ropempō means to send someone out with loving care — spiritually, practically, and materially — so God’s work can continue.

Our responsibility as the church is to help or "propempo" those who are on the mission field. To provide for those who've been called to **go**.

Churches should support missionaries. Especially, those who go to the unreached. And when I say church, I mean every one of us. Me and you. This is our part and our responsibility! Every single person in this room. If you are the follower of Christ you should take part in mission. One way or the other.

If you are not going to the mission field yourself. Help or "propempo" or send forward someone else. It is very biblical. And I think this is how it's supposed to be. We should not concentrate only on our needs and challenges. Looking down on our problems, getting stuck in our routine. We should not get stuck in the mentality "oh... I can't do it. It's for only for rich people. It's not the time. Mission is dead" whatever is your excuse is. Bible says:

### John 4:35
³⁵...Behold, I tell you, raise your eyes and observe the fields, that they are white for harvest.

### RESPOSIBILITY #1
We should raise our eyes from our every day problems and challenges. And observe the fields. Our responsibility as the church, as those who *stay home*. Is to make sure God's work can continue. When the opportunity presents itself we should participate in God's mission. In fact we should look for opportunity to do our part in God's mission!

### Our fellowship
You know, this very church became possible only because there are churches who helped and continue to help. Maybe I can tell you the whole story some day. But, my family, Rodda's family were able to come and start this work because someone was obedient to the scriptures. Someone **propemo**, sent us forward. And today we can enjoy the **fruit** of their obedience.

Before we continue to read. I have to mentions also that we of course should be wise about who we support and etc. Bible talks about that a lot too, but it's outside of our scope for today.

### Romans 15:25-29
>²⁵but now, I am going to Jerusalem, serving the saints.²⁶For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.²⁷For they were pleased *to do so,* and they are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they are indebted to do them a service also in material things.²⁸Therefore, when I have finished this, and have put my seal on this fruit of theirs, I will go on by way of you to Spain.²⁹I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.

### Churches should stay connected
We not gonna focus on this verses too much. Even though they contain very important principles. They can be summarized as "Churches should have relationships and partake in needs of one another." It's a sign of a healthy church fellowship. Today we as a fellowship are on receiving side of this equation. We've been helped by other churches. In different ways. But, my dream is that one day, we would be those who help.

### Romans 15:30-33
>³⁰Now I urge you, brothers *and sisters,* by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,³¹that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea, and *that* my service for Jerusalem may prove acceptable to the saints;³²so that I may come to you in joy by the will of God and relax in your company.³³Now the God of peace *be* with you all. Amen.

In this scriptures Paul shares about his plans and needs. Asking for prayer. Paul anticipates trouble during his time in Jerusalem. And asks the church to pray for him. Also, he asks to pray for successful accomplishment of his mission.

### RESONSIBILITY #2
This is the second way how we should support the mission. We should pray for the missionaries. Financial support is important. But also prayer support is equally as important. Prayer is a moving power of every ministry. I think often we underestimate the power of prayer. Otherwise we would spend way more time and effort praying.

So, we should pray for the missionaries we support. Because it's not about "pay off" to God.  We should know what's going on in their ministry. What's are the needs at the moment. Stay tuned, stay connected. Stay interested. And it's not even that hard.

### Reward 
And as we partake in the mission. By sending people, by supporting mission work, by paring for the missionaries. We will also partake in their fruit. We will not miss the reword. In this life AND more importantly in the future life. 

### Matthew 10:41,42
⁴¹The one who receives a prophet in *the* name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward; and the one who receives a righteous person in the name of a righteous person shall receive a righteous person’s reward.⁴²And whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold *water* to drink in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he shall by no means lose his reward.”

So yes, on one hand by supporting missionaris we give away. We give away our finances. We sacrifice our time in prayer. But on the other hand, as it often happens in the Kingdom of God, we receive. And we receive so much more. I believe that even in this present life God Blesses us so much greater then we give. But also, we give away perishable gold, the one that is only good in life present. But we receive perishable treasure that will remain relevant for eternity.
