Greeting brothers and sisters, we are back to our regular study. To the book of Romans. And at this point we are on the finish line. There are about 1,5 chapters left. And today we going to continue with the chapter 15. 

Last time we studied Romans on Thanksgiving. Right before we had a "Christmas break". But no we're back! We stopped at the verse 20. So, today we will pick up from there.

But before we will read our scripture for today, let's rewind a few verses back where apostle Paul explains His role in God's plan. Providing some more reasons why he have written this letter. And very importantly what gave him the authority to speak into the life of that church.

Because remember, Paul did not established church in Rome. In fact he have never visited them. So, even though Paul was quite famous and controversial figure in Christian circles of the first century. He was not a part of that church. In a way he was a stranger. I think many have heard about him. But as for the church he was an outsider.

So, Paul writes this:

### Romans 15:15,16
>¹⁵But I have written very boldly to you on some points so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given to me from God,¹**⁶to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles**, ministering as a priest the gospel of God..., ~~so that *my* offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit~~.

Paul was a minister of **Christ Jesus** to the **Gentiles**. He had a unique role. He was appointed personally by Jesus Christ. He had a special mission and responsibility. To bring the Gospel of Christ to the Gentiles(non Jewish people). And authority that he had was unique to Him.

Unlike regular pastor of the church. When your authority AND responsibility bound by the very concrete group of people that God trusted you with. Paul's authority and responsibility stretched over ALL gentiles. Across multiple churches. It was also backed by the power of the Holy Spirit. Which is very important.

### Romans 15:19
>¹⁹in the power of **signs** and **wonders**, in the **power of the Spirit**; so that from Jerusalem and all around as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.

Paul presents the fruit of his ministry. Proof of his validity. Proof that he is a real deal. That God is with Him.

This verification was necessary. Because in a new testament time, and it is still true to this day, there were a lot of false teachers, false prophets, self proclaimed leaders etc.

People who cover up their hidden motives with Christian appearance. People ho have their own ambitions, agenda. Who pursue their won gals. Who try to use the church of God for their own purposes.

Jesus Himself warns us about it:

### Matthew 7:15-18,20
 ¹⁵“Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.¹⁶You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn *bushes,* nor figs from thistles, are they?¹⁷So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.¹⁸A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.²⁰So then, you will know them by their fruits.

People can fool you and me. They can fake christian character. So much so that you cannot tell who is who until you see the fruit. The results of their work.

And this is real. Even in our own church we already experienced that. When people come, they smile into your face. They say nice things, presenting the best version of themselves in public. On Sundays, during the small groups throughout the week.

They know all the right words. Know all the right answers. Can quote scriptures upon scriptures. And you look at them and think

>"Oh, this person way better them me. I don't know bible nearly as well. I have issues with my character. But this guy/girl is perfect. Perfect follower of Christ. How come you are not the pastor or something..."

But then... At the same time this people engage in behind-the-scenes maneuvering to achieve their own goals. To satisfy their ego. Or I don't even know what.

They go around approaching people in private saying things like "Let's start our own church. This guys don't know what they are doing. They are too this, they are too that... Church should be this. Church should be that...This church missing this and that... They don't let people serve and etc."

It's a real problem that still exist. Maybe it is happening right now. I'm not gonna know. They not going to come to me. They gonna come to you.

It is especially challenging in the setting like ours. When we have new people joining our fellowship every week. On one hand you want to encourage people to serve, to edify one another. And on the other hand you want to prevent "ravenous wolves", as Jesus called them,  from having a go.

### Back to Paul
So, even though apostle Paul was very famous figure. For this particular church he was an outsider.

He did not hesitate to provide a prove that his motivation is pure. That he have authority given by God. That he CAN BE TRUSTED. And all he says is to help the Church to excel. To be the church God want's them to be. All that he says add's value. Builds up.

He did that by presenting the fruit of His work up to that moment. Second half of the verse 19:

### Romans 15:19
¹⁹...from Jerusalem and all around as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.

And then he says following:

### Romans 15:20-24
²⁰And in this way I aspired to preach the gospel, not where Christ was *already* known by name, so that I would not build on another person’s foundation;²¹but just as it is written: 

“THEY WHO HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD ABOUT HIM WILL SEE, AND THEY WHO HAVE NOT HEARD WILL UNDERSTAND.”

 ²²For this reason I have often been prevented from coming to you;²³but now, with no further place for me in these regions, and since I have had for many years a longing to come to you²⁴whenever I go to Spain—for I hope to see you in passing, and to be helped on my way there by you...

He explains why he have never visited them. And now, even though he counts on their financial support to continue his ministry in Spain, he is not after money. 

Paul in his letter openly shares all his concerns, suggestions and expectation. Advice and etc.

First of all he have authority to do that. As we could see. And also he did things right way. Which is an example for us to follow.

### Application?
There is no place for plotting, "pulling the strings" so to speak, in the Church. Church is not the place for trying to "Wheel a deal".

If you have genuine concerns go the leaders. Go to a pastor and present them there. Openly. Start praying about it. It does work.

But If instead you are going around the church sabotaging the work of God. Please, Stop. You are not serving the Lord. You gonna summon the wrath of God on yourself. Please, go do something else. There are plenty of things to be busy with.

If someone coming to you and start to make you doubt your church. Leaders, pastor whatever. You don't have to listen to that. 

I really liked the response of one of the people who had experienced that situation few years ago. He said:

"If you have real concerns. Let's go to the pastor together and talk them through..." 

Don't let seeds of the doubt to grow in your heart. This is how the enemy work. Right from the beginning. When someone comes to you and tries to makes you to doubt your faith, your church, your church leaders. They are not concerned about you. They have their own agenda in doing so. It is not the God's way of doing things. This is how the enemy works. 

Remember, by their fruit you'll know them.
