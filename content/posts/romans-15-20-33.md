### INTRO
Greetings church, even though we have been finished with our book last Sunday, today we are back to Romans. We skipped a small, but very important section of the previous chapter. So, I really wanted to go back and revisit a few verses.

### MISSIONS
We will be reading form the Romans 15 verses 20-33. And talk about missionary work.

I think today is a perfect Sunday to do that. We have visiting team of missionaries from Tbilisi. They will be serving with us and I'm sure will be a blessing for our church for some time. So, please get to know them while there here. Show them some love and attention. Also we have also heard from Matt about their missionary journey with the Lord here in Georgia. Praise God!

So, I think I'm not going to be wrong if I'll say that quite a few people in our church are passionate about missions. It's definitely true for me and my wife. We are no strangers to mission. It's been our life for the last 15 years and we still pursuing this path. It's just the best job in the world [MEME https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_ts9DSIh0g]

### WHY?
But no one get's born with an understanding of the God's heart for mission. There were time when I had no idea. There is no shame in it. I didn't see my place and role in mission. I didn't understand missions and my responsibility. I didn't even know that there is a responsibility!

### Thing of the past
I've though that  **"a missionary"** is the thing of the past! Dead profession. Like **Lamblighters** and **Knocker-Upers**[IMG https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*O6NY4iNjTxh494-9oZTemg.jpeg] I bet you never heard about **Knocker-Upers** before. They would go around the city and wake people up in the morning by knocking on their windows and the doors. Waking people up, so that they can get to work on time. But then alarm clock was invented and this profession became a obsolete.

And today profession of a Knocker-Uper, even though was important at some point, is now dead. Turned into a history, maybe a hobby. Today you not gonna find professional Kncker-upers. No one need them anymore. Their time faded away. Their role have been taken due to industrial revolution. By alarm clocks and eventually by our phones.

And in some rare cases by your neighbor, who wakes you up first thing in morning on your day off with his drill. :)

### Same with missions?
And for same reasons many people believe that the "missionaris" as a profession suffered the same fate. Missionaries became obsolete due to the technical progress or some other reasons. Maybe that how you think as well. Just as I though few years back... Well, fine... a bit more then *few* years, more like 2 decades back... But anyway,  it's probably even mo so today. When AI Hype is through the roof. When *technologia* mad another big leap. 

It worth coming back to the source. And reevaluate whether we still up to date. So, today I want to bring biblical perspective into our attention. I want us to reflect, to understand that mission is **not dead**. It's still relevant. And will continue to be relevant until Jesus comes back. Actually I think more accurate is to say that, **WHEN** we will fulfill this mission, **THEN** Jesus will come back.

Unfortunately we not going to be able to have a comprehensive look on missions in the bible tonight. We will only have a brief glimpse. "*Touch on few things*, so to speak". We will explore what is our responsibility as a church in regards of mission. Let's start reading:

### Romans 15:20-21
²⁰And in this way I aspired to preach the gospel, not where Christ was *already* known by name, so that I would not build on another person’s foundation;²¹but just as it is written: 

“THEY WHO HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD ABOUT HIM WILL SEE, AND THEY WHO HAVE NOT HEARD WILL UNDERSTAND.”


### PAUL - PIONEER
In this verses Paul briefly talk about his role, his vision and his attitude towards the work of the Gospel. He explains why he is always on the move. And have never settled anywhere. Why he never became a pastor of the church or something? Even though he started so many of them.

He quotes prophet Isaiah in the verse 21 to defend his position. As an argument and explanation. It shows that it was not just Paul's idea. He did not peruse desire to travel around or something. He simply obeyed the scriptures. Which is written in **Isaiah 52:15** :

>### Isaiah 52:15
>¹⁵And he will startle many nations. Kings will stand speechless in his presence. For they will see what they had not been told; they will understand what they had not heard about.

### HIS APPROACH
Today we would call apostle Paul a "pioneer", a church planter. The person who reaches out to the "unreached". Areas and people groups that never heard the Gospel. That have no church. That have no opportunity to hear the Good News. In doing so Paul fulfills God's dream.

- WHAT? What is the **God's dream?**

### God's dream
You can see it all through out the bible. But, my favorite and the most concise description is in 1 Timothy 2:4:

### 1 Timothy 2:4
...**all people** to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

Heart of God stretches to every single person. Regardless of their nation, social status, financial well being etc. Jesus made it clear. He *lead the way*, so to speak. And Paul became one of the first workers to implement this idea. God have called Paul to take the Gospel to the Gentiles specifically, which was unheard of.

### ALL NATIONS
Until God called Paul. No one ever even considered that Gospel needs to be taken to all nations.

Remember that it was at the time when the wast majority of the followers of Christ were Jews. And quite a few of them believed that salvation is not for Gentiles. They've had a special meeting, a council. Where *the tipity top*, *the apostles* gather together to decided whether Gentiles can be saved. We not gonna go into that, it's just to bring a little bit of the perspective.

### FIRST MISSIONARY
Therefore I would consider Apostle Paul be a fist missionary of the new testament. At least the one that is well known. Missionary who focused specifically on taking the Gospel to those who never heard it. Who have no Idea. This type of ministry was brand new. "Outside the box" for the people of Pauls time. He had to prove that it's actually biblical. Which he did.

### PAUL'S EXAMPLE
Apostle Paul sets an example for us. That we should focus on reaching out the unreached. Go into the nations and areas that have no local church. Go into communities which never heard the Gospel. And give them chance to hear. And tell them that God loves them. Give them chance to be saved.

The job listings for that is still out there. God still calling people. We can go back to the prophet Isaiah:

### Isaiah 6:8
 ⁸Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?” Then I said, “Here am I. Send me!”

This words are still relevant. God is still looking for workers. Who will be willing to say "Here am I. Send Me!".

### Called to Go
There are people, who are called to go. This is the will of God. And I know that we have such people in this room. People who read this verses, and it resonates with your heart. And this is great! This is how it should be!

When we read the bible we see that all of us, every single one, should be the messenger of the Gospel. But also we can see that not everyone chooses mission as their **profession**, as a life style.

That's what defines **a missionary**, and sets him apart in the body of Christ.

Missionary - is the one who chose mission work as their **profession**. He is the one Who've been sent, released by the church.

But as for majority of regular church people, it is probably not the case. Majority will stay home in the local church. So, what about us, me and you, those who stay, who continue to go to the church and serve God at home? What is my role in all this mission business?

### TOPIC
And this is exactly what we will focus on tonight. Apostle Paul writes his letter to the church in Rome. To the regular people who love the Lord. Who go to work, go to church. You know... mere mortals. Just like me and you. So, whatever we find in this letter applies to us. Let's read from the verse 23:

### Romans 15:23-33
 ²³but now, with no further place for me in these regions, and since I have had for many years a longing to come to you²⁴whenever I go to Spain — for I hope to see you in passing, and to be helped on my way there by you, when I have first enjoyed your company for a while

### Help to those who go
The key phrase for this section in our context today is **"to be helped by you on my way there(Spain)"**. Paul expresses hope that church in Rome will support him in his upcoming mission trip. That they will help him to take the Gospel to Spain.

Let's note that Apostle Paul find it appropriate to request help and support for his mission from this church. He invites Romans, and remember he had no prior connections with this church, to join Him in his vision of taking Gospel to Spain. He invites them to invest their resources into this work. 

### Propempo
When he says "*I hope to be helped*" by you, he uses the Greek word "propempo".

> πρό (pro) = before / forward

> πέμπω (pempō) = to send

> propempō = to send forward

In the New Testament, propempō often includes:

* Providing food

* Providing money

* Providing travel help

* Showing respect and blessing

* Making sure the person lacks nothing for the journey

Simply put:

> ropempō means to send someone out with loving care — spiritually, practically, and materially — so God’s work can continue.

Our responsibility as the church is to help or "propempo" those who are on the mission field. To provide for those who've been called to **go**.

Churches should support missionaries. Especially, those who go to the unreached. And when I say church and churches, I mean every one of us. Me and you. This is your part and your responsibility! Every single one of us. Every person in this room. If you are the follower of Christ you should take part in mission work. One way or the other.

If you are not going to the mission field yourself. Help or "propempo" or send forward someone else. It is very biblical. And I think this is how it's supposed to be. We should not concentrate only on our own needs and our own challenges. Looking down on our problems, getting stuck in our routine. We should not get stuck in the mentality of *"I can't do it. It's for only for rich people. It's not the right time. Mission is dead"* -  whatever your excuse is. Jesus says:

### John 4:35
³⁵...Behold, I tell you, raise your eyes and observe the fields, that they are white for harvest.

### RESPOSIBILITY #1
We should raise our eyes from our every day problems and challenges. And observe the fields. Our responsibility as people of God, as the church, as those who *stay home*. Is to make sure God's work continue. When the opportunity presents itself we should participate in God's mission. In fact we should look for opportunity to do our part in God's mission!

### Our fellowship
You know, this very church started because some other churches propempo few missionaries. In fact they continue to do so after all this years. Maybe I can tell you the whole story some day. But, my family, Rodda's family were able to come and start to work because someone was obedient to the scriptures. Someone **propemo**, sent us forward. And today we can enjoy the **fruit** of their obedience.

We've heard great testimony of Rodda's. It's all because they've been sent forward. By the churches of God.

Before we continue to read. I have to mentions also that we of course should be wise about who we support and etc. Bible also talks about that a lot, but we not gonna have time to talk about it today. So, let's continue reding from the verse 30.

### Romans 15:30-33
>³⁰Now I urge you, brothers *and sisters,* by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,³¹that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea, and *that* my service for Jerusalem may prove acceptable to the saints;³²so that I may come to you in joy by the will of God and relax in your company.³³Now the God of peace *be* with you all. Amen.

In this scriptures Paul shares about his plans and needs. Asking for prayer. Paul anticipates trouble during his time in Jerusalem. And asks the church to pray for him. Also, he asks to pray for successful accomplishment of his mission.

### RESONSIBILITY #2
It is the second way to support mission. To pray for the missionaries. Financial support is important. But prayer support is equally as important. We believe in the power of the prayer. Prayer is a moving force of every ministry. I think often we underestimate the importance of prayer. Otherwise we would spend way more time and effort interceding.

We should pray for the missionaries we support. Because at the end of the day we not trying to "pay off" to God, as some sort of a fee or something. We should be involved, not only financially, but also emotionally, our heart should be involved in the process. We should know what's going on in their life and ministry. What's are the needs at the moment. We stay tuned, stay connected. And it's not even that hard.

### Reward 
And as we partake in the mission. By sending people, by supporting mission work, by praying for the missionaries. It's not one way road. Not only we share in their needs, we also share in their reword. In this life AND more importantly in the future life.

>### Matthew 10:41,42
>⁴¹The one who receives a prophet in *the* name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward; and the one who receives a righteous person in the name of a righteous person shall receive a righteous person’s reward.⁴²And whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold *water* to drink in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he shall by no means lose his reward.”

So on one hand by supporting missionaries we give away. We give away our finances. We sacrifice our time in prayer. But on the other hand, as it often happens in the Kingdom of God, we receive. And we receive so much more.

### Conclusion
So, today we reminded ourselves that mission is not dead. God still looking for workers. Fields are still ready for harvest.

We discovered that even if we don't chose to go, it doesn't mean you have no part in missions work. We are still responsible and we still:

* We should **propempo** - to send/support people with loving care — spiritually, practically, and materially — so God’s work can continue.

* We become true partners, share their challenges, prayer for them.

And by partaking in the work God is doing through them. We will not loose our reward.

**Practically**: - Have an offering for team before they leave?
