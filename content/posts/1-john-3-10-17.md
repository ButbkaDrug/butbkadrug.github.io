# Born of God


## To be born of God.
Most of us without a doubt will call ourselves "Christians". We so used to this name. It is so dear to us and we are so attached to it, that many people almost believe that maybe even Jesus Christ himself secretly started to call his disciples *Christians*. And it's not a bed name don't get me wrong. That's not what I'm saying. What I want to say is simply that this is **NOT** how God calls us. 

### Origin of the name
Depending on the context sometimes, it is not all that important. But sometimes the difference is crucial. First of all it was not even disciples or followers who invented the term **"Christians"**. If we would to look into acts 11:25-26. We would see how and even where this name takes it's origin:

>### Acts 11:25,26
>²⁵So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,²⁶and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a great many people. **And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians.**
<!--TIME: 1:10-->

It was *other people* who started to call followers of Christ **Christians**. It started off as a nickname. Like a collective description of the group of people with the same interests. As we call some groups like **Rednecks**, **Nerds**, **Christians**...

And today there are a lot of people consider themselves *a Christian* for variety of different reasons. In countries with a strong cultural bond, like Georgia. People often say something amonth the lines: "My parents were Christians, and grandparents were Christians, therefore I'm a Christians". In minds of many to be Georgian is to be Christian. It's not exclusive to Georgia, there are other nations like that. Because, Christianity in their mind is a part of their cultural heritage. It's a tradition. Just a title. And often it has very little to do with the faith and lifestyle.

All together, it is not very reliable term this days. **This world** called us Christians. But, God gave us the other name. There is a biblical concept that does way better job in defining who is who.And that is **To be born of God**.

### Born of God
Jesus introduced the idea that you should **be born again**. Born from the spirit. When he talked to Nicodemus. Who was the teacher of the law and one of his(Jesus's) secret followers.

>### John 3:3,5
> ”³Jesus answered him(Nicodemus), “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.”⁴Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?”⁵Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God

In his letter John continue to unfold this idea. He says: "**we are God's Children NOW**" In the verse 1. We already talked about it a little bit last Sunday. God loved us so much, that he not only took away our sin. But he also, made us a part of His family. How great is that? In the verse 9 we get a bit more explanation. We can see more connection with what Jesus were saying to Nicodemus:

>### 1 John 3:9
>⁹ No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for **God's seed abides in him**; and he cannot keep on sinning, because **he has been born of God**.

Today I want us to pay closer attention to this two statements:

* He(the person) Has been born of God
* God's seed abides in him(person)

This two statements are very important. We not gonna be able to cover their meaning in full today and in depth. There is not enough nether time, nor the knowledge, that I poses. But, nevertheless we will shed some light on it.

### Not yet transformed, but already children
In verse 2 John saying that **we already are Children of God**. We are not yet *transformed*. John says:

>### 1 John 3:2
>²Beloved, we are God's children now, and **what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him**, because we shall see him as he is.

We still to undergo some major transformation. We will receive new glorified body, like one Jesus have. There are few places in the new testament which describe this. I can share a list if you want to go and read about it more. We will briefly read one to give you an idea if you never heard of it yet.

>### Philippians 3:20,21
>²⁰But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,²¹who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.

It is an interesting topic but it is outside of our scope for tonight. The main point that I want to emphasize is that, despite that we still in our old bodies, which suffer from diseases & fleshly desires we **ALREADY ARE** children of God. When we come to God. When we confess our sins. When we genuinely repent and accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior. We receive Holy Spirit and we get **BORN AGAIN** - experience radical transformation in our relationship with God. We become children of God.
<!--TIME: 6:40-->

### Foreigners in this world
We become foreigners to this world*. Verse 1 says that this world does not know us. Because we broke that intimate bond, that deep relational connection with this worldly system. We cannot be recognized. We belong to a different kingdom now. We cannot be a part of both worlds.

There is a key difference that separates us. That makes us incompatible with this worldly system. We belong to a different kingdom, from a difference family if you will. We were reborn and **God's** **seed** abides in us.

It is very important to truly understand what that mean. This word **SEED** is an interesting word. Seed is something that produces new life. Produces offspring.

<!--WARN:The Greek word, not that it is important, but I want you to remember what we have talked about, and it might help, Greek word sounds like:

>σπέρμα spérma, sper'-mah; from G4687; something sown, i.e. seed (including the male "sperm");-->

I'm not too much into agriculture and biology. But one thing that I know it that seeds always produce same type of species. You can't grow banana trees from apple seeds. Mountain lions don't give birth to monkeys. And the same among the humans. We are very much like our parts. Weather we like it or not, with the seed we inevitably inherit some core characteristics.

My childhood was not a "*bed of roses*". In my teenage age i decided I don't want to have anything to do with my dad. And I would meticulously get rid of any similarities, weather it is a way of talking, some behaviours, anything that I could spot. And you know what? I didn't succeed very much. I thought I did. But, we still look alike. Once I got old enough I realized that unconsciously I'm actually a lot like my father. Because, his seed is in me. There is no way around it.

When we get born of God. We experience this rebirth in our spirit. It's not just words. It's a fact that we accept by faith. You might feel it physically, or not. But it shows through. This radical change in our relation to God cannot go unseen. Let's have look at some most noticeable changes

### 1 John 3:4-9
 ⁴Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.⁵You know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.⁶No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him.⁷Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.⁸ Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.⁹ No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God.
 <!--TIME: 10:40-->

First noticeable difference is that changes our attitude to sin. In verse 4 we read that sin is lawlessness, and to practice sin is to practice lawlessness. Let's break down this term into a simpler words.

>**To practice lawlessness** means to **regularly** or **intentionally** engage in actions that disregard or violate laws, rules, or norms. It implies a **consistent** habit or behavior of acting without respect for the authority.

In other words it means that those who sinning disregard God's law, and therefore disregard God, the one who created the law.

>To disregard someone - means to ignore them, treat them as unimportant, or show a lack of consideration or respect for them. It involves not acknowledging their feelings, opinions, or presence.

You don't treat anyone you love in this fashion. But this is perfect description of how people of this world live their lives. They do not consider God. His feelings, opinions or presence. They *make practice of sinning* and it doesn't bother them a bit.

Once we were just like that. We loved to sin. We were proud of our sins. Maybe we would even compete with our friend who would take it further. We made plans to sin. We would reflect on our past sins with a great satisfaction. We used to find great pleasure and comfort in our sins.

This is regular state of mind, state of heart of someone who is, as John says, of the devil. If you love sin, then devil is your father.

>### 1 John 3:8
>⁸ Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.
<!--TIME: 12:33-->

Again, I will repeat myself and say that we are not talking about occasional sin. We all sin time to time. And John addresses it in the very beginning of his letter.

>### 1 John 1:8
>⁸ If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.

No, we talk about people who love to sin. Who is not bothered by it. Who chose sin as their lifestyle. Who finds pleasure, enjoys their sins and plan to continue. As verse 8 says people who **make a practice of sinning** or as the other translation says **who love to sin**. They are of the devil. That's the people of this worldly system. They are not of God. Any such person never seen or knew God.

### 1 John 3:9
⁹ No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God.

When we born of God. Once His seed start to abide in us. We become new creatures. We inherit our father's characteristics. And since he hates sin. We start to hate sin too. It is not about our will power. It becomes our nature. 

For example I like rules. And I really dislike when people break the rules. It bothers me a lot. And you know my son, big surprise, is just as much into rules as I am. How much will power, of effort it took him to become like that? Non, he inherited this from his parents.

So, as John says 

### 1 John 3:7
⁷Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.

### 1 John 3:3
³And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.

### 1 John 3:9
⁹ No one born of God makes a practice of sinning...

### 1 John 3:10
¹⁰By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother.

Do not let devil to deceive you. If we adhere to this 4 principles:

* Don't love sin
* Love brother
* Practice righteousness
* Purify ourselves

Then we can be sure, God's seed abides in us. You've been born of God. **YOU ARE** the child of God who was born from death to life.
