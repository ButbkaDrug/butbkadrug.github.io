### PRE
This is our hall. It was truly a miracle when Jeff and Christina found it. It’s a great place for the church, and we have different ministries happening here every single day.

You know, we were among the few who started this church eight years ago. And I can say with confidence that Jeff and Christina have made a real impact on this church. They are a true blessing, so thank you for helping make it possible for them to come here.

Through them, God led our family into a new area of ministry—pastoring the church. So let me briefly share a couple things we do.

### MONDAY
On Monday nights, we have our English Club. It’s one of our main outreach ministries. We invite people to improve their English through conversation with native speakers.

This gives us many opportunities to share the Gospel. Last year, several people joined the church after coming to English Club. One of them has already been baptized.

This ministry keeps growing and we constantly need more native English speakers.

Praise God!

### Kurdish Kids
My wife Alyona actively helps at the “Kurdish School” ministry ran by members of our church. School for “street kids” or beggars. Actually they don't live on the street. They have families and homes. They are Muslim. None of them can read or write — both children and adults.

We teach them basic skills: reading, writing, and simple math. But most importantly it gives us opportunity to share the Gospel with them. It can be very challenging. These kids grow up on the streets, and it shows. We do our best and trust Holy Spirit to do the rest.

### Bible study
We also have dedicated bible study groups for Man, Woman, preteens, teenagers and yang adults thought the week.

### Russian speaking home group
Few month ago we have lonched a Russian-speaking home group. Bible study for those who are new to faith.

And there is more...

### SUNDAY
Also before our main service on Sunday, we host a church service for Indian students. They run it themselves, and we only help when needed. Their service is in Malayalam and English, often switching between the two. It’s very interesting and very encouraging. May God bless them.

Our main service starts at 5:00 p.m. That might seem a bit unusual, but this is how God led us from the very beginning. We gather for worship, prayer, studying God’s Word, and fellowship.
