### PRE
Let’s walk together to the church, where I’ll share about the ministries we have throughout the week.

Here we are. In this building, on the 7th floor, we rent a hall for our services. It was truly a miracle when Jeff and Christina found it. The location is great, and the owners are wonderful people. Even though they are not believers, they are happy to have us here. It’s very hard to rent a space in Batumi as a Christian church, so we feel extremely blessed.

This is our hall. Most of our activities happen here. It’s a great place for Sunday gatherings and fellowship afterward. Throughout the week, we also have different ministries happening here almost every day.

Let me briefly share about the main ones.

### MONDAY
On Monday nights, we have our English Club. It’s one of our main outreach ministries. We invite people to improve their English through conversation with native speakers. Lately, we’ve had over 40 people attending every Monday, most of them non-believers.

This gives us many opportunities to share the Gospel. Last year, several people joined the church after regularly coming to English Club. One of them has already been baptized.

This ministry keeps growing, and we’re reaching our limits. We need more native English speakers so we can keep the discussion groups at a reasonable size.

Praise God!

### TUESDAY
On Tuesday mornings, my wife Alyona helps at the “Kurdish School.” In short, it’s a school for Kurdish children, often known as “street kids” or beggars. They don’t actually live on the street. They have families and homes. Most of them are Kurdish people from Azerbaijan who come to Georgia because begging is allowed here. They are Muslim and illiterate. They have never attended school, and none of them can read or write—both children and adults.

We try to teach them basic skills: reading, writing, and simple math, and we also share the Gospel with them. It can be very challenging. These kids grow up on the streets, and it shows. We do our best and constantly pray for extra love and patience.

In the evening, we have a teenagers’ group, or teenage Bible study. Teenagers from our church learn to lead worship, connect with one another, and have fun together. Most importantly, they study God’s Word.

### WEDNESDAY
On Wednesday nights, we have a men’s group. We gather to dive deep into God’s Word and encourage one another. It’s an important time where we help each other continue growing in our faith.

Men from other churches also join us, including some Orthodox believers who want to study the Bible more deeply. Praise God!

### THURSDAY
On Thursday nights, our music team gets together to prepare for the Sunday service.

### FRIDAY
On Fridays, we have two groups meeting at the same time.

The first is a young adults group that meets here at the church. It’s a place for international young people in Batumi to come together, build friendships, and get to know God. This is another outreach ministry, especially among international students.

Young men and women gather to fellowship, worship God, and study His Word.

At the same time, we have a Russian-speaking home group. This Bible study is for those who are new to the faith, who have recently joined the church, or who are not Christians yet but are curious and want to learn more.

This group started just a couple of months ago, so we’re excited to see what God will do through it.

### SATURDAY
On Saturday mornings, we have a women’s group. Most of the time, it’s a Bible study, but occasionally they also have workshops on different topics. It’s a time for women to study God’s Word and connect with one another in a more relational way. It’s very edifying and encouraging.

After that, we have a group “just for girls.” Right now, this meets once a month. It’s a time for younger girls to learn important life skills from more experienced women. It’s fun, practical, and full of wisdom, as God’s truth is passed naturally from one generation to the next.

In the evening, we have a Bible study for pre-teens. They come to learn Scripture in a way they can understand. It’s a beautiful time when the wisdom of both the Old and New Testaments is revealed to children. They love it, and we love it too.

### SUNDAY
Sunday is, of course, the time when the whole church comes together. Before our main service, we also host a church service for Indian students. They run it themselves, and we only help when needed. Their service is in Malayalam and English, often switching between the two. It’s very interesting and very encouraging. May God bless them.

Our main service starts at 5:00 p.m. That might seem a bit unusual, but this is how God led us from the very beginning. We gather for worship, prayer, studying God’s Word, and fellowship.
