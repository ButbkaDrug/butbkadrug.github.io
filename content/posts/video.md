### PRE
Let's walk together to the church where I'll share about the ministries we have throughout the week.

Here we are. In this building, on the 7th floor we rent a hall for our services. It was a miracle when Jeff and Christina find it. Location is great. Owners are wonderful people, even though they are not believers, they are happy to have us. It's hard to rent in Batumi as a christian church, so we feel very blessed.

This is our hall. We have most of our activities here. It's great place for Sunday gatherings. And fellowship afterwords. Also, every day of the week we have some ministry happening here as well.

Let me briefly share about the major once.

### MONDAY
On Monday night's we have our English club. It's one of our main outreach activities. It's a place where we invite people to improve their English though the conversations with a native speakers. Lately we have over 40 visitors attending English club every Monday. Most of which are non believers.

It gives us opportunity to share Gospel with them. And last year several people joined the church after they've been coming to English. One of them already got baptized. 

This ministry keep growing and we reaching our limitations. We need more native English speakers in order to keep discussion groups of reasonable size.

Praise God!

### TUESDAY
On Tuesday in the morning my wife Alyona helps at the "Kurdish School". In two words it's a shoal for the "Kurdish kids", more known as "beggers" or "street kids". They don't actually live on the street. They have families and houses. Most of them are Kurdish people from Azerbaijan, They come to Georgia because begging is allowed here. They are Muslim, they are illiterate. Never went to school. None of them know how to read and write. Both children and adults.

So, we try to teach them some basic knowledge. Reading, writing, basic math. As well as share Gospel with them. It's challenging at times. This kids grow on the streets. But we try to do our best. Always praying for extra love and patience.

In the evening we have a group for teenagers. Or Teenage bible study. Where teenagers of our church learn to lead worship. Where we connect and have fun together. And most importantly study God's word.

### WEDNESDAY
On Wednesday nights we have Man's group. Where we gather to deep dive into the word of God and admonish one another. It is important time when we help one another to keep growing in our faith.

We have mans from other churches who join our man's group. Even some orthodox believers who want to study bible more. So, Praise God!

### THIRSDAY
On Thursdays night our music team have time to get together and prepare for the Sunday Service. 

### FRIDAY
On Friday we have two groups happening at the same time.

Group for Yang adults. They  meeting here at the church. It's a place for International youth of Batumi to come together. And get to know one another and get to know God. It's another one of our outreach activities. Especially among international students.

Boys and Girls gather together to fellowship. To worship God. And to study his word.

At the same time on Firday we have a Russian Speaking Home Group. It's a bible study for those who are new to faith. Who recently joined the church. Or those who are not christian yet. But they are interested to know more. 

This group started only couple month ago. So, we exited to see what God is going to do there!

### SATUDAY
On Satuday mornings we have women's group. Typically it's a bible study time. But every so often they have workshops on different topics. It's time for the ladies to study the word of God and connect with one another in a more relational manner. It's a very edifying and encoraging time.

After that we have a group "only for girls". This one is only once a month for now. It's time when girls have opportunity to learn important life skills from our more experiences ladies. It's a fun time when practical skills and the wisdom of God get's passed on from one generation to another. In a very natural way.

After that in the evening we have bible study for the pre-teenagers. When they can come and learn the bible. It's a beautiful time when books of new and old testament reveal their wisdom in the way children can understand. They love this time. And we love it too.

### SUNDAY
And Sunday is of course is the time for the church to come together. But before we have our main service, we facilitate Church service for Indian Students. They run it by themselves we help only when they need our help. Their service go in Marialam and English. Often switching from one to the other at the random times. It's very interesting. And very encouraging. May God bless them.

Our main service starts at 5pm. Maybe it's a bit unusual. But this is how God lead us from the very beginning. We gather for worship, prayers, studying God's word and fellowship. 


### Thank you
