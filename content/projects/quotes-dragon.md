![Quotes Dragon Bot](https://butbkadrug.github.io/quotes-dragon.jpeg)

## Overview

The Quotes Bot for Telegram is a chatbot that I made for fun and learning. I think it can be entertaining and inspirational. You can check it out on [Quotes Dragon](https://t.me/quotes_dragon_bot).

## Features

- **/commands:** You can prompt the bot with commands as always.

- **Voice Notes Support:** The bot is also capable of recognizing speech (Russian).

- **Free text recognition:** You can type your request in a "free text" form, and the bot will do its best to understand you.

Voice/Free text recognitions are not super advanced but sufficient for what they are.
