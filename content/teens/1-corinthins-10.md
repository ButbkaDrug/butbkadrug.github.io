### 1 Corinthians 10:1-33
 ¹For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea,²and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,³and all ate the same spiritual food,⁴and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ.⁵Nevertheless, with most of them God was not pleased, for they were overthrown  in the wilderness.

 Fist of all we continue to talk about the "meat" or about things that can lead others to sin. Just to clarify for once more, we not talking about legalistic demands of other people. But rather when our behavior can lead those who weak in faith to sin. 

 In this bit Paul clearly talking to the Jews. Because, gentiles would have no idea what have happened in the desert. Moreover they would not call those people "fathers". But in jewish context it makes perfect sense. 

 What he is saying is that despite they all followed the same leader. In modern terms we would say they went to the same church. Listened to the same sermons. Have all seen the same, great miracles but still most of them remained in their old ways.

 So, it is not belonging to a certain group of people make you please God. Because, if we rephrase what Paul is saying, they it would be something like "They all considered themselves Christians. But still most of they perished in the wilderness because God was not pleased with them."

 If you think about it. They were God's special people. Then all this trouble to get them out of Egypt. And most of those, who came out of Egypt died in the desert.

 ⁶Now these things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as they did.⁷ Do not be idolaters as some of them were; as it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.”⁸ We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day.⁹We must not put Christ  to the test, as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents,¹⁰nor grumble, as some of them did and were destroyed by the Destroyer.¹¹Now these things happened to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come.¹²Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall.¹³No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.

 ### BREAK ###
 Paul reminds us that we should be careful with the freedoms we take.

 Some concrete things:
 * Idolatry (Exodus 32)
 * Sexual immorality (Numbers 25?)
 * Testing the Lord(Numbers 21:4) 
 * Grumble(Numbers 14, 16)

 And that no one is immune to the failure. Temptations and tests are real. They are part of our life. And if you don't going through anything now. You will definitely will. But God is good and give you grace. And helps you during those times. He ensures that whatever you got yourself into, not going to break you. 

 We privileged to be children of God but it doesn't mean that we became immune to temptation. It doesn't mean we cannot fall. And guess what, when you fall, most of the time you don't even know about until you hit the ground hard. You might think you all good and well. You not like "them". You are free, not under the yoke of the law, rules and traditions. But, then reality can slap you into face and remind you that you are just a regular, everyday human. 
 ### END ###

 ¹⁴Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.¹⁵I speak as to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say.¹⁶ The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?¹⁷Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.¹⁸Consider the people of Israel:  are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar?¹⁹What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?²⁰No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons.²¹ You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.²² Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?

 ²³ “All things are lawful,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful,” but not all things build up.²⁴ Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor.²⁵ Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience.²⁶For “the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof.”²⁷If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience.²⁸But if someone says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience —²⁹I do not mean your conscience, but his. For why should my liberty be determined by someone else's conscience?³⁰If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?

 ³¹So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.³² Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God,³³just as I try to please everyone in everything I do, not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved.
