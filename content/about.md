Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Viktar, programming enthusiast currently living in Georgia. Here's a bit about me:


I have a passion for programming and have had the pleasure of working with various languages over the years. Here are some languages I've explored:

- JavaScript
- Lua
- Python
- Golang


Apart from coding, I have a few other interests:

- **Music:** I love both listening to and playing music. It's a great way for me to relax and unwind.
- **Learning:** I have a strong desire to continuously learn new things and acquire new skills. The ever-evolving tech world keeps me on my toes!
- **Helping Others:** I find joy in helping others, whether it's through programming assistance or sharing knowledge.

# Family Life
I have loving wife and three amazing kids who bring so much joy and happiness to our life.
